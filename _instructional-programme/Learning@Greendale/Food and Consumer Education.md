Aimed at empowering our students to be health ambassadors, food innovators and discerning consumers. It takes into consideration new lifestyles and consumer trends, and therefore, it equips them with knowledge, skills and attitudes related to health and financial management.

The focus of the FCE curriculum in Greendale Secondary School is to equip students with basic culinary skills, knowledge of nutrients and recipe modification for various diet-related diseases. Student-centred pedagogies and teaching strategies with the inclusion of Activity-based Learning (ABL) and Differentiated Instruction, are adopted to enhance student competencies in building self-awareness, social awareness and responsible decision-making through the use of current and relevant online platforms.
