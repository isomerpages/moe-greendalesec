### Vision:

Productive employees, Contributing members of society

### Mission:

Develop employability skills and values in the service sector

The Elements of Business Skills (EBS) syllabus is designed as an introduction to business concepts by understanding business activities, focusing on basic marketing and customer relations, in Singapore’s context. Students will have opportunities to acquire foundational business knowledge and develop transferable employability skills in the service industry, namely the Travel and Tourism, Hospitality and Retail industries.

The service industry continues to play a significant role in Singapore’s economic growth and offers employment opportunities. With globalisation, changing demographics and technological advancement, businesses are innovating and reinventing themselves to stay ahead of the competition. The study of EBS in the selected industries would provide students with opportunities to learn and develop 21st Century Competencies needed to thrive in an increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world.

In the **EBS syllabus framework** shown below, the concepts of basic marketing and customer relations are at the core of the EBS syllabus. The middle ring represents the outcomes of syllabus, namely foundational business knowledge, decision-making skills and an enterprising mindset. The outer ring defines the scope of the syllabus to be within the three service industries of Travel and Tourism, Hospitality and Retail.
