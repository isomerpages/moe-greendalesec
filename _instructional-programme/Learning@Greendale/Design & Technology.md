The Design and Technology department strives to enhance our students 21st century skills and competencies of Critical, Inventive Thinking and Global awareness through the use of the Design Thinking Process. Our rigorous curriculum provides opportunities for students to acquire skills in sketching, Computer Aided Design (CAD), Rapid Prototyping (3D printing), basic technologies and artefact building to create practical solutions to solve real-world problems. During this process, students will also be able to build values such as empathy, responsibility, integrity and self-discipline.

The lower secondary D&T curriculum is integrated with our Applied Learning Program (ALP) which develops competencies in coding, robotics and technology. In Sec 1, we have the “Sustainability and Clean Energy theme” where students develop deep understanding of the importance of renewable fuel source and environment protection. This is done through a design-and-make self-powered car project. In Sec 2, the department collaborates with Singapore Institute of Technology which is an Institution of Higher learning for the SIT Community Challenge. This SIT Community Challenge enables us to partner with a community organization to co-create solutions to solve community challenges. The challenge aims to increase students’ awareness of issues that affect the community and encourage them to take actions to tackle the issues by developing solutions to engage the community. It provides an invaluable experience for our students to put the design thinking process in action.

**"IMAGE CAROUSEL"**

The upper secondary curriculum builds on the fundamentals the students have learnt from their lower secondary with a focus to prepare them well for the graduating coursework and National exams. Students will deepen their understanding of empathy and able to do research to understand and define user needs, explore and develop design solutions, making a prototype and finally, realising their conceptual idea into a physical product by using equipment and machines in the workshop. Students will also learn basic technology such as electronics, mechanism and structures to enhance their projects to better suit their problem needs. With strong foundations, our students has consistently excel in the National exams and develops a life skill that can apply beyond secondary school education.
