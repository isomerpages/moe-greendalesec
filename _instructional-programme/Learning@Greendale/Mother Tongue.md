##### EXPOSURE

**Theatre & Drama Appreciation**  
  
We believe that MTL is a living language. We want to develop students' awareness of cultural identity and cultivate an appreciation of their cultural roots. Through going to the theatre, students are exposed to the use of MTL outside classroom settings. These experiences will help MTL to stay relevant to our students' life.

The Chinese drama performances that we organised for our CL students this year include:

1. Chinese Cross Talk Laughter For All Ages《相声老少乐2019》by 新风相声学会 on 4 July at SOTA Drama Theatre for Secondary 1 and 2, and

2. Chinese Musical Play -- Rock Guardians of the Sea  音乐剧——《守护海洋的神岛》by The Fool Theatre Ltd on 5 July at Drama Centre for Secondary 2 and 3.

**Creative Writing Competition (Lower Sec)** 

The Creative Writing Competition aims to provide a platform for students to master their MTL. Sec 1 Chinese students will have the chance of being a news reporter, while the Secondary 2 students need to design a brochure which showcases the cultural aspects of our Nation. For Malay Language, the Secondary 1 and Secondary 2 students are given a topic and students are required to write the essays based on their knowledge and creativity.

##### EXTENSION

**MTL Fortnight - Learning Journey and Workshops**

To create a more robust learning environment for students to use MTL, and with the goal to kindle students’ interest in the languages through novel and exciting ways, we invite external instructors to conduct workshops and we also bring students out for learning journey. Some examples are “Drama Workshop”, “River Hongbao Tour”, “Cultural Heritage Walk”, “Mid-Autumn Festival Tea Culture Learning Journey and “Fun-with-Riddles Workshop”.

Secondary 2 and Secondary 3 Normal (Technical) students were given an opportunity to learn about acting and dramatization from a theatre company. It was clear that the students welcomed the opportunity to express themselves in many ways.

Secondary 3 Express and Normal (Academic) students were enrolled into a workshop – _Pentas Peribahasa_ or Transforming Idioms into a short skit. They had the opportunity to experience the idioms on a more personal level and deeper understanding. After which, they had the chance to act out and get their fellow peers to guess the idioms.
