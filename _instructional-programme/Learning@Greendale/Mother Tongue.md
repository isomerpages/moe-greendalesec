##### EXPOSURE

**Theatre & Drama Appreciation**  
  
We believe that MTL is a living language. We want to develop students' awareness of cultural identity and cultivate an appreciation of their cultural roots. Through going to the theatre, students are exposed to the use of MTL outside classroom settings. These experiences will help MTL to stay relevant to our students' life.

The Chinese drama performances that we organised for our CL students this year include:

1. Chinese Cross Talk Laughter For All Ages《相声老少乐2019》by 新风相声学会 on 4 July at SOTA Drama Theatre for Secondary 1 and 2, and

2. Chinese Musical Play -- Rock Guardians of the Sea  音乐剧——《守护海洋的神岛》by The Fool Theatre Ltd on 5 July at Drama Centre for Secondary 2 and 3.

**Creative Writing Competition (Lower Sec)** 

The Creative Writing Competition aims to provide a platform for students to master their MTL. Sec 1 Chinese students will have the chance of being a news reporter, while the Secondary 2 students need to design a brochure which showcases the cultural aspects of our Nation. For Malay Language, the Secondary 1 and Secondary 2 students are given a topic and students are required to write the essays based on their knowledge and creativity.

##### EXTENSION

**MTL Fortnight - Learning Journey and Workshops**

To create a more robust learning environment for students to use MTL, and with the goal to kindle students’ interest in the languages through novel and exciting ways, we invite external instructors to conduct workshops and we also bring students out for learning journey. Some examples are “Drama Workshop”, “River Hongbao Tour”, “Cultural Heritage Walk”, “Mid-Autumn Festival Tea Culture Learning Journey and “Fun-with-Riddles Workshop”.

Secondary 1 students learning about ‘Wayang Kulit’ or Shadow Puppets. Students were tasked to create their own puppets and come up with a story line to act out using their puppets.

Secondary 2 and Secondary 3 Normal (Technical) students were given an opportunity to learn about acting and dramatization from a theatre company. It was clear that the students welcomed the opportunity to express themselves in many ways.

Secondary 3 Express and Normal (Academic) students were enrolled into a workshop – _Pentas Peribahasa_ or Transforming Idioms into a short skit. They had the opportunity to experience the idioms on a more personal level and deeper understanding. After which, they had the chance to act out and get their fellow peers to guess the idioms.

For National Malay Poetry Recital Competition at Raffles Girls School, ARISSA NADYNE M R wrote and recited a poetry entitled Sang Nila. Sang Nila Utama’s pursuit of his dream through the discovery of Singapore Island truly inspired Arissa and thus the poetry. Below is her entry.

**_Sang Nila Pemacu Jaya_**

_Terpacak tegap nama Sang Nila Utama_ <br>
_Di sana kau inginkan pulau idaman_ <br>
_Di sana kau inginkan ketenteraman_ <br>
_Pulau indah dan bersih_ <br>
_Ombak mendayu-dayu_ <br>
_Pasir pantai putih berbuih_ <br>
_Menjadi penyeri hati yang rintih_

_Malangnya dalam engkau meniti pulau itu_ <br>
_Kau dilanda onak dan duri_ <br>
_Tatkala bahtera dilayari_ <br>
_Malam gelap kilat menerangi_ <br>
_Guruh dan taufan turut menemani_

_Namun Sang Nila, kau teguh berdiri_ <br>
_Menghadap lautan bergelora_ <br>
_Yang lapar menggila kerana inginkan mahkota_ <br>
_Kau sanggup berkorban_ <br>
_Biar mahkota hilang abadi_ <br>
_Asalkan pulau menjadi idaman hati_ <br>
_Asalkan anak kapal setia berdiri_ <br>
_Kau berjuang dengan berani_ <br>
_Tanpa rasa gentar dan rugi_ <br>
_Kau cekal dengan pulau idaman hati_

_Akhirnya bahtera melabuhkan tirainya_ <br>
_Kau terpersona dengan serinya_ <br>
_Kini kau berada di pulau idaman_ <br>
_Namun secara tiba-tiba_ <br>
_Seekor singa datang menerpa_ <br>
_Kau merenung mata Si Singa_ <br>
_Kau dan singa bertentangan mata_ <br>
_Sinar matanya memukau jiwa_ <br>
_Akhirnya kau menang dalam renungan itu_ <br>
_Kerana kau tahu nilai pulau ini_ <br>
_Pulau ini idaman hati_ <br>
_Lalu kau namakan pulau ini Singapura_ 

_Kini terpacak tegap nama Sang Nila Utama_ <br>
_Aku menganggapmu sebagai idola_ <br>
_Kerana kau langsung tidak berpaling tadah_ <br>
_Kau teguh bertekad memahat sejarah_ <br>
_Sang Nila Utama_ <br>
_Kau di sanubari anak Singapura_
