##### EXPOSURE

**Theatre & Drama Appreciation**  
  
We believe that MTL is a living language. We want to develop students' awareness of cultural identity and cultivate an appreciation of their cultural roots. Through going to the theatre, students are exposed to the use of MTL outside classroom settings. These experiences will help MTL to stay relevant to our students' life.

The Chinese drama performances that we organised for our CL students this year include:

1. Chinese Cross Talk Laughter For All Ages《相声老少乐2019》by 新风相声学会 on 4 July at SOTA Drama Theatre for Secondary 1 and 2, and

2. Chinese Musical Play -- Rock Guardians of the Sea  音乐剧——《守护海洋的神岛》by The Fool Theatre Ltd on 5 July at Drama Centre for Secondary 2 and 3.

**Creative Writing Competition (Lower Sec)** 

The Creative Writing Competition aims to provide a platform for students to master their MTL. Sec 1 Chinese students will have the chance of being a news reporter, while the Secondary 2 students need to design a brochure which showcases the cultural aspects of our Nation. For Malay Language, the Secondary 1 and Secondary 2 students are given a topic and students are required to write the essays based on their knowledge and creativity.
