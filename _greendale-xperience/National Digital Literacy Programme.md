In March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) to help students strengthen their digital literacy. Throughout their educational journey, students will be able to acquire digital skills across four components in the “Find, Think, Apply, Create” framework.

At Greendale Secondary School, the use of technology is a key enabler to empower our students to be self-directed learners, nurture a culture of collaborative learning and lead a healthy digital lifestyle. Our students will be able to purposefully leverage digital technologies to monitor and manage their own learning and connect with peers and teachers confidently to promote diversity of ideas and acquire interpersonal skills.

**Personal Learning Device (PLD)**

One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) to all secondary schools whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed PLD by end-2021.

The PLD will enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world.

The PLD which the school will be using is the Acer Chromebook Spin R753TN (Enhanced).

Students who are Singapore citizens can use their Edusave to pay fully or partly for the PLD, after setting aside provision for payment of 2nd tier miscellaneous fees. Subsidies are available for students who require funding support to purchase the PLD.

**Supporting Students in the Responsible Use of the Devices**

The school will put in place measures to create a safe and conducive learning environment for students in the use of PLDs for teaching and learning. This will include:

*   Classroom management and routines
*   Educating students on Cyber Wellness
*   Installation of Device Management Application (DMA) on all students’ devices to provide a safe learning experience for your child, and to prevent misuse of the device.

**Educating students on Cyber Wellness**

MOE has made significant changes to the Character and Citizenship Education. Cyber Wellness lessons will feature significantly in the CCE2021 lessons.

Topics covered in the Cyber Wellness lessons include:

*   Cyber Use
*   Cyber Identity
*   Cyber Relationships
*   Cyber Citizenship
*   Cyber Ethics
