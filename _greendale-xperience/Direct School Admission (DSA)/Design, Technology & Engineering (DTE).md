<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Students accepted under the DSA-DTE programme can look forward to exciting
programmes and activities that will enhance their skills and competencies
in coding, robotics, and technology. There will also be opportunities to
partner and collaborate with institutions of higher learning and industries.
Students will receive a well-rounded, holistic, and enriching experience.</p>
<p>Below are some of the key programmes and leadership development opportunities
that successful DSA-DTE students can look forward to:</p>
<h3>Highlights - <strong>Robotics Club</strong></h3>
<p>Students accepted under DSA-DTE will be directly allocated to the Robotics
Club as their Co-Curricular Activity (CCA). This CCA offers many opportunities
for students to participate in various competitions, such as the <strong>IDE Series (Arduino Maker category)</strong>, <strong>DSTA-DSO-VJC Robotics Challenge</strong>,
and <strong>Drones Odyssey</strong>. Through these competitions and the
CCA, students will develop their creativity, inventive thinking, design
thinking, and problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>Students will also be trained in:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>3D printing</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Designing with CAD software (e.g., Autodesk Fusion 360, SolidWorks)</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Electronics</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These skills will be applied in their projects and competitions. Additionally,
students will have the chance to take on leadership roles in the Robotics
CCA as Executive Committee (EXCO) members or CCA leaders starting from
Secondary 3. They will be given the opportunity to attend the <strong>Aspiring Leaders’ Training</strong> in
Secondary 2 and, if selected, the <strong>Inspiring Leaders’ Training</strong> in
Secondary 3.</p>
<h3>Highlights - <strong>SIT AI Workshop and 3D Printing Workshop</strong></h3>
<p>Students will have the opportunity to participate in various workshops
organized by the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT).</p>
<p>For the <strong>AI Workshop</strong>, students will:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Explore the fundamentals of AI through interactive discussions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn to use tools like <strong>ChatGPT</strong> and <strong>Teachable Machine</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deepen their understanding of responsible AI use</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Highlights <strong>- STEM Exposure &amp; Industrial Visits</strong></h3>
<p>Students will be exposed to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics) and will have the chance to go on industrial visits. Some
of the possible programmes include:</p>
<p><strong>Learning Journey to Weston Robot</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will be introduced to the field of robotics through hands-on
experiences with modular robots, robot dogs, exoskeletons, delivery robots,
and more. This journey will provide students with an excellent platform
to see how robotics is applied in industries and real-world scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Google Office Visit</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will have the opportunity to visit the exciting and impressive
Google office. They will also attend a sharing conducted by Googlers, which
aims to inspire them in the field of STEM.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Highlights - <strong>Overseas STEM Trip</strong></h3>
<p>Students will also be given the opportunity for overseas STEM trips which
aim to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>expose them to STEM education and development in other countries,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepen their 21st&nbsp;Century Competencies of global awareness and cross-cultural
skills and sensitivities,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to help students realise how countries are utilizing technologies as a
competitive advantage to improve life and economy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to create awareness of foreign cultures and the interconnected world</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Highlights - <strong>Competitions</strong></h3>
<p>In addition to the competitions held by the Robotics Club, students will
have the opportunity to participate in other national competitions, such
as the <strong>Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition</strong> organized
by the Defence Science Organisation. Students will design and build small
unpowered, bungee-launched gliders to achieve the farthest and most precise
flight, demonstrating their creativity and innovation.</p>
<h3>Highlights - <strong>SIT Community Challenge</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>SIT Community Challenge</strong>, a signature programme for
the Secondary 2 cohort, focuses on using <strong>Design Thinking</strong> to
solve community problems. Through their <strong>Design &amp; Technology</strong> lessons,
students will apply Design Thinking to identify problems and propose solutions
while developing their creativity and collaboration skills.</p>
<p>Finalists will attend workshops conducted by SIT and its partners to prepare
for the competition. They will represent the school in the <strong>SIT Community Challenge Finals</strong>,
where they will present their ideas to judges from community partners such
as the <strong>Land Transport Authority</strong>, <strong>ST Microelectronics</strong>, <strong>James Dyson Foundation</strong>,
and SIT. The finals are open to the public, offering students a platform
to enhance their presentation and communication skills.</p>
