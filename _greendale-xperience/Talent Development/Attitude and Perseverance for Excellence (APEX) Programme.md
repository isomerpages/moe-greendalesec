The APEX Programme represents a specialised programme within the Cognitive domain tailored to cater to our top-performing students. It aims to cultivate individuals who exhibits critical thinking and innovation, coupled with a positive Attitude and Perseverance to attain Excellence.

To achieve this, a group of teachers will work closely with the chosen students to push the boundaries of their potential and to strengthen the essential competencies required for them to be future-ready.

Students enrolled in the APEX programme will go through a 3-year programme, during which they participate in key programmes including:

**Book Reading**

In alignment with our belief in the paramount importance of reading as a life skill, each APEX student will be presented with a copy of “7 habit of highly effective teenagers” as a welcome gift. This gesture is to signify the importance of inculcating a regular reading practice among our students, which is crucial in their growth and holistic development.

**Design Thinking Workshop**

In this one-and-a-half-day workshop, students are instructed in the methodologies that underpin the Design Thinking process, which encompass the essential phrases of Empathy, Define, Ideate and Prototype. Students are required to apply the new-gain skills as they embark on the task of addressing actual design challenge situation in the school.

In 2023, the design challenge for the students was to conceptualise a community garden in the school. To enhance their understanding and preparation for the task, a learning journey to HortPark was conducted to equip students with the foundational knowledge necessary to handle their design challenge.

**Learning Journey and Competitions**

The APEX students benefit from a diverse array of programmes and activities aimed at broadening their horizons. These experiences nurture their critical thinking and awareness of societal concerns.

In 2023, the students went on a Learning Journey to Singrow, where they learned about innovation, food security and food sustainability in Singapore.

They were also actively engaged in the “Live-On Festival” competition where they were tasked to craft essays that offered their perspectives on healthcare issues in Singapore.

**Study Skills and Public Speaking Opportunities**

The Secondary 1 students will go through a comprehensive set of Study Skills modules, designed to equip them with the essential strategies for academic excellence. These modules encompass areas such as time management and effective note-taking techniques.

In addition to these fundamental skills, students will also be provided with opportunities to foster their confidence and to refine their public speaking abilities through sharing sessions with the cohort.
