At Greendale Secondary School, our mission is to grow the hearts and minds of our students. Our school’s vision, ‘Every Greendale Student a Lifelong Learner, Critical Thinker and Servant Leader’ encapsulates the desire of the school to shape the future-ready Greendale student who would be prepared for and thrive in the 21st-century with the necessary skills and mindsets.

The GTDP aims to ensure that every learner’s educational experience is appropriate, challenging and differentiated across the cognitive, leadership, physical and aesthetics domains.

**Greendale Talent Development Framework and Approach**

*Fig. 1: GTDP Framework*

In the GTDP framework (Fig. 1), talent is classified into 4 domains: Cognitive, Leadership, Physical and Aesthetics. Within each domain, there are specific programmes which are differentiated into 3 levels of *Exposure, Extension and* *Excellence*.

Within the framework of the Exposure, Extension, Excellence approach (Fig. 2), programmes at the Exposure level are intended for all students. These programmes are intentionally crafted to encourage participation, and they form the foundational components of our Greendale Signature Programmes, including programmes such as the SIT Community Challenge and Level Camps.

Students who demonstrated interest and readiness within the respective domains will be offered opportunities to engage in advanced enrichment activities aimed at fostering deeper passion and honing their skills at the Extension level. Some of these programmes encompass the Class Exco Training Programme, and involvement in the planning and executing of events such as GaRang Competition and Sea Expedition.

Programmes at the Excellence level are specifically tailored for students who demonstrate strong aptitude in the respective domains. At this level, the programmes are designed to focus on enhancing and optimising the competencies of smaller groups of students.

**Highlights of Programmes at the Excellence Level:**

***IDE (Innovation, Design and Engineering) Series***

IDE (Innovation, Design and Engineering) Series is a prominent national event centered around Technology and Engineering. The primary objective of this competition is to present students with challenging problem-solving opportunities spanning various domains such as electronics, programming, and mechanical design.

Our Secondary 3 students participated in the IDE Challenge 2023. They leveraged their creativity, critical thinking and problem-solving skills to effectively tackle a diverse array of engineering challenges. Two of our teams emerged as the champion and first runner-up respectively.

***Humanities - Model United Nations Conferences***

Model United Nations is a distinctive event that simulates the proceedings of a United Nations (UN) conference. Here, participants are given the invaluable opportunity to assume the role of delegates representing diverse countries, fostering collaborative efforts aimed at addressing pressing global issue. At the end of the event, outstanding delegates are recognised and given an award.

The MUN platform is an instrumental platform for students, facilitating the acquisition of vital research skills, enabling the development of multifaceted perspectives on global issues and promoting the demonstration of critical thinking as they engage in debates with fellow delegates. These global issues encompass matters such as border and territorial disputes, armament concerns, and human trafficking among others.

Our school has forged a productive partnership with ACS(I), known as the B4 programme, where selected Secondary 3 students undergo specialised training in conjunction with the ACS students to equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge essential for their participation in the Model United Nations Conferences.

In the year 2023, seven of our Secondary 3 students participated in the B4 programme and joined the MUN conferences hosted by SCGS and ACS(I). Two of our students received the Honourable Mention award in recognition of their outstanding presentations and contributions during the conferences.
