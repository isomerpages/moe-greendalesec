<p>Leadership is one of the key competencies which the school strives to
develop in our students. Greendale’s Student Leadership development is
based on the principles of Servant Leadership, where we aim to groom our
students to be confident leaders with the heart to serve. This is in line
with our school’s motto:&nbsp;<strong><em>Serve, Lead, Excel.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Students accepted under DSA-Leadership will be developed through a comprehensive
and rigorous leadership development programme so that they will have the
ability and confidence to take on leadership roles at various platforms
in Greendale Secondary School. These students will be closely guided and
mentored to achieve a well-rounded education here at Greendale Secondary
School and go on to be inspiring servant leaders beyond their secondary
school years.</p>

<p>Selected student leaders look forward to Greendale’s signature Servant
Leadership Training Programme. This curated programme aims to equip our
student leaders with the knowledge and skills to grow as leaders. Our &nbsp;Secondary
2 Student Leaders are mentored by their seniors to develop servant leadership
traits. Students have the opportunity to hone their leadership skills and
put them to practice. These skills put them in good stead to take on key
leadership appointments in Secondary 3.</p>
<p>Student Leaders who take on formal leadership appointments in Secondary
3 will have the opportunity to learn important planning skills, with particular
focus on the Servant Leadership traits of Foresight and Conceptualisation.
Leaders are empowered to put these skills to practice during the training
programme. They will also have the chance to plan the Secondary 1 Orientation
Camp for their juniors.</p>
<p>Our student leaders go through a variety of training programmes and get
opportunities to plan activities and events throughout the year to become
better servant leaders who are able to&nbsp;<strong>SERVE</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>LEAD</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>EXCEL</strong>.
Below are some of the highlights of opportunities for students to lead.</p>
