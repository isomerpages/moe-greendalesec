<p>Leadership is one of the key competencies which the school strives to
develop in our students. Greendale’s Student Leadership development is
based on the principles of Servant Leadership, where we aim to groom our
students to be confident leaders with the heart to serve. This is in line
with our school’s motto:&nbsp;<strong><em>Serve, Lead, Excel.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Students accepted under DSA-Leadership will be developed through a comprehensive
and rigorous leadership development programme so that they will have the
ability and confidence to take on leadership roles at various platforms
in Greendale Secondary School. These students will be closely guided and
mentored to achieve a well-rounded education here at Greendale Secondary
School and go on to be inspiring servant leaders beyond their secondary
school years.</p>

<h3>Inspiring Leaders’ Training Programme</h3>
<p>Student Leaders who take on higher leadership appointments in Secondary
3 are placed on&nbsp;<strong>the Inspiring Leaders’ Training Programme</strong>.
This programme is a year-long mentorship programme which equip our leaders
to take on greater challenges in their roles as leaders of their CCAs or
leaders in school. Students have the opportunity to learn important planning
skills, with particular focus on the Servant Leadership traits of Foresight
and Conceptualisation. A highlight of the Inspiring Leaders’ Training Programme
is the training camp typically held in Gopeng, Perak. Leaders have the
opportunity to put these skills to practice during the camp and they will
also have the chance to plan the Secondary 1 Orientation Camp for their
juniors.</p>
