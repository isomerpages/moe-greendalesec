<h1>DSA@Greendale Secondary School</h1>
<h2>Leadership</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Leadership is one of the key competencies which the school strives to
develop in our students. Greendale’s Student Leadership development is
based on the principles of Servant Leadership, where we aim to groom our
students to be confident leaders with the heart to serve. This is in line
with our school’s motto:&nbsp;<strong><em>Serve, Lead, Excel.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Students accepted under DSA-Leadership will be developed through a comprehensive
and rigorous leadership development programme so that they will have the
ability and confidence to take on leadership roles at various platforms
in Greendale Secondary School. These students will be closely guided and
mentored to achieve a well-rounded education here at Greendale Secondary
School and go on to be inspiring servant leaders beyond their secondary
school years.</p>

<p>Below are some of the key programmes successful DSA-Leadership entrants
can look forward to:</p>
<p><strong><em>Student Leadership Training Programmes</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Selected student leaders look forward to Greendale’s signature Servant
Leadership Training Programme. This curated programme aims to equip our
student leaders with the knowledge and skills to grow as leaders. Our &nbsp;Secondary
2 Student Leaders are mentored by their seniors to develop servant leadership
traits. Students have the opportunity to hone their leadership skills and
put them to practice. These skills put them in good stead to take on key
leadership appointments in Secondary 3.</p>
<p>Student Leaders who take on formal leadership appointments in Secondary
3 will have the opportunity to learn important planning skills, with particular
focus on the Servant Leadership traits of Foresight and Conceptualisation.
Leaders are empowered to put these skills to practice during the training
programme. They will also have the chance to plan the Secondary 1 Orientation
Camp for their juniors.</p>
<p>Our student leaders go through a variety of training programmes and get
opportunities to plan activities and events throughout the year to become
better servant leaders who are able to&nbsp;<strong>SERVE</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>LEAD</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>EXCEL</strong>.
Below are some of the highlights of opportunities for students to lead.</p>
<p><strong>Leaders in Action</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>Sec 1 Orientation: Camp R<sup>3</sup>ISE</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The Sec 1 Orientation programme is the pinnacle event organised by a team
of Student Leaders who have undergone the Servant Leadership Training Programme.
The event is meant to welcome the new Secondary 1 students to the school
and consists of a series of activities organised by the student leaders.</p>
<p><strong><em>Games Carnival</em></strong>
</p>
<p>One of the main events organised by the Sports Leaders is the Games Carnival.
This event, usually held in July, is an opportunity for Greendale students
to come together to build class spirit while competing in a wide array
of sporting events.</p>
<p><strong><em>Teachers’ Day</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Another major event planned by Student Leaders is the Teachers Day Celebration
in September. Led by the Student Council, the event requires the Student
Council to work with their peers to design and plan the school-wide programme.</p>
<p><strong><em>Student Engagement Sessions</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Greendale Engage is an opportunity where students look forward to each
year to have their voices heard. The annual engagement sessions are organised
by the Student Council, where they have the chance to plan, moderate the
session, listen to the voices of their peers, and propose ideas to address
issues raised.</p>
<p><strong><em>National Education Commemorative Days</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Our Student Leaders are involved in advocating key character and citizenship
education messages and school values. They serve as emcees at various school
events such as Racial Harmony Day and National Day, and make use of social
media to share positive messages.</p>
