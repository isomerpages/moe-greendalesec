<h2>Design, Technology &amp; Engineering (DTE)</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Students accepted under DSA-DTE can look forward to exciting programmes
and activities that will further develop their skills and competencies
in coding, robotics and technology. There will also be opportunities to
partner and work with Institutions of higher learning and industries. Students
will receive a well-rounded holistic and enriching experienced.</p>
<p>Below are some of the key programmes and leadership development for successful
DSA-DTE students can look forward to:</p>
<h3>Highlights - <strong>Robotics Club</strong></h3>
<p>Students who are accepted under DSA-DTE will be given direct allocation
to Robotics Club as his/ her CCA. The CCA provides many opportunities for
the students to take part in various competitions such as Toy Design Competition,
IDE series (Arduino Maker category, VEX Robotics competition and Drones
Odyssey Challenge, Infineon Chips @ School competition. Through the competitions
and CCA, students get to develop their creativity and inventive thinking
skills, design thinking and problem-solving skills. Students are also trained
in 3D printing, design using CAD software like Autodesk Inventor and Solidworks
and electronics skills which they will use to apply in their projects and
competitions.</p>
<p>Students who are accepted under DSA-DTE will also be developed to take
up leadership position in Robotics CCA as EXCO or CCA leader in Secondary
3. They will be given the opportunity to attend the Aspiring Leaders’ Training
in Secondary 2 and will continue to undergo the Inspiring Leaders’ Training
in Secondary 3 if they are selected to be the Robotics CCA leader.</p>
<h3>Highlights - <strong>SIT SkillsCraft Youth Makers Programme</strong></h3>
<p>Students will be given the opportunity to take part in the Singapore Institute
of Technology (SIT) SkillsCraft Youthmakers programme which is a collaboration
between Greendale Secondary and SIT. This programme aims to inspire the
students and spark their interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and
Mathematics (STEM).</p>
<p>Students will:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Attend workshops conducted by SIT lecturers on Design Thinking, 3D Printing,
DIY (Household) Hacks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participate in meaningful STEM activities and projects that contribute
to the community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opportunity to be mentored by the lecturers in competitions or projects</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Highlights - <strong>STEM Career Exposure &amp; Industries Visit</strong></h3>
<p>Students will be exposed to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and
Matematics) career and go on industry visits to gain exposure to possible
STEM careers. Following are some programmes:</p>
<p><strong>“A day in the life of…” @ Infineon Technologies Programme</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To inspire and motivate students to think about a career in Engineering
in the semiconductor industry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this programme, students get to experience first-hand a typical day
of an Engineer working in an MNC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Programme includes: Company Introduction, SMART Factory Tour to appreciate
how SMART technologies is incorporated in the day-to-day running of the
factory, Career @ Infineon Technologies and Job shadowing and interaction
with an Engineer mentor for a day</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Google Office Visit</strong>
</p>
<p>In this programme, students get to tour the visit the exciting and impressive
Google office. Students will also attend a workshop conducted by Googlers
to enthuse them in STEM.</p>
<h3>Highlights - <strong>Overseas STEM Trip</strong></h3>
<p>Students will also be given the opportunity for overseas STEM trips which
aim to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>expose them to STEM education and development in other countries,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepen their 21st&nbsp;Century Competencies of global awareness and cross-cultural
skills and sensitivities,</p>
</li>
<li>
