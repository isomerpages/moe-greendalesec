### Introduction

Leadership is one of the key competencies which the school strives to develop in our students. Greendale’s Student Leadership development is based on the principles of Servant Leadership, where we aim to groom our students to be confident leaders with the heart to serve. This is in line with our school’s motto: **_Serve, Lead, Excel._**

Students accepted under DSA-Leadership will be developed through a comprehensive and rigorous leadership development programme so that they will have the ability and confidence to take up leadership roles at various platforms in Greendale Secondary School. These students will be closely guided and mentored to achieve a well-rounded education here at Greendale Secondary School and go on to be inspiring servant leaders beyond their secondary school years.

Below are some of the key programmes successful DSA-Leadership entrants can look forward to:

_**Student Leadership Training Programmes**_

Selected student leaders look forward to Greendale’s signature Aspiring Leaders (for Secondary 2 students) and Inspiring Leaders (for Secondary 3 students) training programmes. Secondary 2 potential Student Leaders are mentored by their seniors to develop servant leadership traits. Students have the opportunity to hone their leadership skills and put them to practice. These skills put them in good stead to take on key leadership appointments in Secondary 3.

Student Leaders who take on formal leadership appointments in Secondary 3 are placed on **the Inspiring Leaders’ Training Programme**. This programme is a year-long mentorship programme which equip our leaders to take on greater challenges in their roles as leaders of their CCAs or leaders in school. Students have the opportunity to learn important planning skills, with particular focus on the Servant Leadership traits of Foresight and Conceptualisation. Leaders are empowered to put these skills to practice during the training programme. They will also have the chance to plan the Secondary 1 Orientation Camp for their juniors.

Our student leaders go through a variety of training programmes and get opportunities to plan activities and events throughout the year to become better servant leaders who are able to **SERVE**, **LEAD** and **EXCEL**. Below are some of the highlights.

**Training Leaders**

_Class Leaders Workshop & Peer Support Leaders Training_

This workshop is designed specifically for our Class EXCO (Class Leaders & Peer Support Leaders) with the objective of equipping them with the skills to better lead their classes and support their peers. They were also given the time and opportunity to plan some bonding activities for the classes.

_Inspiring Leaders Training Programme_

The Inspiring Leaders Training Programme is organised for appointed student leaders from the Student Council, Sports Council and CCAs to take on their leadership roles and hone their planning and conceptualization skills.

**Leaders in Action**

**_Sec 1 Orientation: Camp R3ISE_**

The Sec 1 Orientation programme is the pinnacle event organised by a team of Student Leaders who have undergone the Aspiring Leaders Training and Inspiring Leaders Training Programmes. The event is meant to welcome the new Secondary 1 students to the school and consists of a series of activities organised by the student leaders.

**_Games Carnival_**

One of the main events organised by the Sports Leaders is the Games Carnival. This event, usually held in July, is an opportunity for Greendale students to come together to build class spirit while competing in a wide array of sporting events.

**_Teachers' Day_**

Another major event planned by Student Leaders is the Teachers Day Celebration in September. Led by the Student Council, the event requires the Student Council to work with their peers to design and plan the school-wide programme.

**_Townhall_**

Townhall is an opportunity where students look forward to each year to have their voices heard. The annual townhall sessions are organised by the Student Council, where they have the chance to plan, moderate the session, listen to the voices of their peers, and propose ideas to address issues raised.

**_National Education Commemorative Days_**

Our Student Leaders are involved in advocating key character and citizenship education messages and school values. They serve as emcees at various school events such as Racial Harmony Day and National Day, and make use of social media to share positive messages.
