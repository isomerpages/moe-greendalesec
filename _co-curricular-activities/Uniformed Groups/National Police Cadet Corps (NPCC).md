<p>In Greendale Secondary School, the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC)
unit is committed to developing cadets into active, responsible citizens
and community leaders. Closely affiliated with the Singapore Police Force,
NPCC provides cadets with unique exposure to crime prevention efforts while
inculcating values such as resilience, integrity, service, and excellence.
Throughout their CCA journey in NPCC, cadets can look forward to training
and enriching activities that develop leadership, personal competencies,
and a strong sense of civic responsibility, equipping them with essential
skills to serve the community and thrive in the 21st century.</p>
<p>CCA sessions in NPCC are highly differentiated as the cadets learn progressively.
The senior cadets will guide and nurture the junior cadets in training
activities. In the process, the senior cadets develop their competencies
and their leadership skills as the junior cadets develop their core competencies.
In addition, there are also planned bonding activities for the fostering
of strong friendships and a sense of belonging within the NPCC cadets.
All cadets can also look forward to attending external training such as
Unarmed Tactics, Crime Scene Investigation, revolver shoot (Secondary 2
and 3), Law Enforcement in NPCC headquarters, Camp Resilience (Outdoor
Learning Exposure at Pulau Ubin) and curated experiential events such as
the National Day Parade, NPCC Annual Parade and visits to Punggol Neighborhood
Police Centre.</p>
<p>Recognized for excellence, the Greendale Secondary School NPCC unit has
attained the Gold Award in the National Police Cadet Corps Unit Overall
Proficiency Award for 16 consecutive years. Outstanding Sec 4 cadet leaders
have also been conferred the SPF–NPCC Badge in recognition of their leadership
and service</p>
