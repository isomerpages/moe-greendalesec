<p>The National Cadet Corps (NCC) strives to develop cadets with a resilient
mind, fit body and committed heart as part of its “Cadet Strong” initiative.</p>
<p>A typical CCA sessions consists of learning about military-related skills
like Individual Field Craft (IFC) or drills, games and fitness training.
Reviews are regularly conducted by our cadet leaders to encourage our cadets
to be confident speakers and reflective learners.</p>
<p>2020 also marks the first year of Greendale becoming an NCC (Air) Unit.&nbsp;A
typical CCA session consists of learning military-related skills like Individual
Field Craft (IFC) or drills, games, fitness training, Radio Control (RC)
flying and aeromodelling lessons. During HQ-organised events, cadets can
expect to enjoy activities like Flying Fox, Archery, Airsoft Rifle, Paintball,
High Elements Course and Rappelling. Regular inter-unit competitions such
as Laser Run, Sports Championship, and Air Competition allow our cadets
to compete and forge friendships with other cadets.</p>
<p>Our cadets demonstrate their skills and knowledge about flight during
practices at the Individual Marksmanship Trainer (IMT) ranges as well as
at the Air Competition. The main highlight after practices is the live
shoot at a 100-metre range. Enrichment activities such as the Precision
Drill Squad (PDS), Aeromodelling and Urban Operation (UO) further engaged
our cadets and strengthened their camaraderie in their NCC journey.</p>
<p>In 2018, the unit were invited to grace the National Day Observance Parade
at Punggol North as part of the Guard of Honour Contingent. In 2025, four
of our cadet leaders represented NCC at the national level in the marching
contingent for the National Day Parade.</p>
<p>The school’s NCC unit have attained the Distinction award for the Unit
Recognition for 16 years including 2024. This award is conferred annually
by NCC. It is awarded by assessing the overall performance of NCC school
units in an academic year. On top of that, the school’s NCC unit’s outstanding
cadet leaders were awarded the Outstanding Cadet Award in 2024.</p>
