<p>The Singapore Red Cross Youth (SRCY) integrates character building, essential
life-saving skills, local community services and overseas humanitarian
projects in its curriculum, with the Red Cross ethos and service to humanity
as core focus. These platforms prepare them for leadership in their families
and communities which is aligned with the Ministry of Education's (MOE)
approach of developing 21st Century Competencies among the youth, focusing
on character and citizenship education.</p>
<p>The SRCY strives to instill the Red Cross spirit and strengthen core values
such as compassion, passion and professionalism in all cadets. By participating
in humanitarian services, cadets are groomed to become good citizens with
a strong sense of civic responsibility.</p>
<p>The school’s SRCY unit has consistently attained the Gold award for the
Excellent Unit Award. This award is conferred annually by SRCY. It is awarded
by assessing the overall performance of SRCY school units in an academic
year. On top of that, the school’s SRCY unit also achieved Silver in the
Junior and Senior categories respectively of the First Aid Championships
in 2025.</p>
