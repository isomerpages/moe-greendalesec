Greendale Broadcasting Corporation (GBC) - a CCA where students get to experience different media-related aspects of holding a live event. As a GBC member, students would learn a myriad of skills required in the setting up of different audio-video systems, video-making and photography.Â 

To further hone the skills that CCA members will acquire through the provision of support for live events, they will be provided with multiple opportunites to take part in photography and video-making competitions - N.E.mation being one of the bigger competitions the CCA regularly takes part in.

Many of our students graduate from the CCA with a better understanding and appreciation for the finer details involved in the background management of a live event.
