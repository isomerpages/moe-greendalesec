<p>Green Club was started in 2024 with a mission to foster environmental
consciousness and sustainable practices within our school community. Our
members are passionate advocates who actively work towards creating a greener
future through education, action, and community engagement.</p>
<p>Beyond awareness, Green Club members develop and implement innovative
projects to address environmental concerns. One of our key activities involves
organising collection drives for recyclable materials, encouraging the
entire school community to participate in responsible waste management.
These initiatives help students develop sustainable habits that extend
beyond school.</p>
<p>The club takes pride in maintaining our school's community garden, where
members learn about sustainable agriculture, composting, and local food
systems. This green space serves as both an educational resource and a
peaceful retreat.</p>
