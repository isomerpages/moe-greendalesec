The Outdoor Adventure Club (ODAC) was set-up in 2010 to cater to the outdoor and adventure enthusiasts in the school.

Activities conducted for ODAC members include Cycling, Camping, Trekking and Hiking. Outdoor skills such as Camp craft (tent pitching, field cooking), First Aid, Rope work, Orienteering and Pioneering are taught and applied during training sessions and camps. Our members are especially skilled at rock-climbing, participating in many rock-climbing competitions.

ODAC Members have contributed to the outdoor community by teaching and sharing of rock- climbing skills with Primary schools such as Greendale Primary School.  
In 2016, members took part in National Orienteering Race and came back with a Silver 'B' division Girls. In G.A.R.an.G competition, our students came in Team 1st, 3rd and 5th in the adventure race.  
In 2017, ODAC members continued their outstanding performance by clinching 'C' Division team Silver in the National Orienteering Race.  
In 2018, ODAC members did the school proud when they came in 1st Runner Up in the mixed team category for the G.A.R.an.G competition.  
In 2019, the ODAC members continued with an excellent showing during the National Orienteering ‘B’ Division. ODAC members clinched ‘B’ Division Team Gold for Male and Female Categories as well as getting 2nd Runner Up for ‘B’ Division Team Male Category. In G.A.R.an.G competition, our ODAC members attained 2nd Runner Up in the All-Male Category.
