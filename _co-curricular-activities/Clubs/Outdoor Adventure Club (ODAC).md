<p>The Outdoor Adventure Club (ODAC) provides students with authentic outdoor
learning experiences that develop resilience, leadership, and a deep respect
for nature. Rooted in experiential education, ODAC is a platform where
students are challenged physically, mentally, and morally through purposeful
adventure.</p>
<p>ODAC members are trained in a wide range of outdoor and expedition skills,
including campcraft (tent pitching and field cooking), rope work, rock
climbing, orienteering, kayaking, navigation, and expedition planning.
These skills are progressively developed through weekly training, outdoor
modules, leadership camps, and national-level competitions. Signature programmes
such as outdoor cooking challenges, climbing courses, sea expeditions,
and adventure camps allow students to apply skills in real-world contexts,
reinforcing learning beyond the classroom.</p>

<p>Beyond technical proficiency, ODAC places strong emphasis on character
and values education. Through challenge and adversity, students learn perseverance,
teamwork, accountability, and self-management. ODAC explicitly develops
21st Century Competencies such as critical and adaptive thinking, communication,
collaboration, and problem-solving. Students are encouraged to lead, serve,
and support one another, fostering confidence, empathy, and a strong sense
of collective responsibility. Respect for nature and environmental stewardship
are also integral, reflected in learning journeys such as the Singapore
Bird Race and outdoor conservation experiences.</p>
<p>Over the past five years, ODAC has achieved consistent excellence at both
school and national platforms. Our teams have performed strongly in competitions
including the National Orienteering Race (Schools), PassionWave Orienteering
Championships, G.A.R.A.N.G Adventure Race, Inter-School Bouldering Competition,
and Springfield Let’s Rock Climbing Competition, with podium finishes across
B and C Divisions. In 2025, ODAC students emerged as B Division Boys Champions
and C Division Boys 3rd Place at NORS, clinched First Place at G.A.R.A.N.G
(Girls’ Team), and attained top results in orienteering and climbing events.
Students have also completed demanding milestones such as a 40km SEA Kayaking
Expedition, 1-Star Kayaking Certification, and annual ODAC leadership camps.</p>

<p>ODAC continues to nurture confident, resilient, and grounded individual
students who dare to challenge limits, grow through adversity, and live
the spirit of adventure together.</p>
