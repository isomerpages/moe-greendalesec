“Every Art Club member is a Leader who is Creative, Confident and Compassionate.’ The club aims to develop all members into creative individuals who are resilient, demonstrate team spirit and possess compassion for others.

To achieve this, our Committee and graduating members led the way in conducting roll calls, bonding activities as well as art and craft tutorials to begin each session. Our weekly activities help to foster in the members a deeper appreciation for various art forms and expose them to different mediums, provide them with opportunities to collaborate with other CCA groups.

To help our members excel, we conduct sessions on various art forms such as watercolour painting, printmaking, metal tooling, stain glass, silkscreen printing, wall mural painting, origami, card making and photoshop editting. We also expose our members to local artwork by bringing them on learning journeys to the Singapore Art Museum, ArtScience Museum and STPI- creative workshop and gallery.

The Club has garnered several awards:  
2 Silver and 3 Bronze awards in the 2017 'Draw my Stamp' Competition.  
1 Gold and 1 Silver awards in the 2018 ‘Draw my stamp’ Competition.  
5 Nominations for public voting for the Public transport competition organized by LTA in 2019  
Won 1 award in the People’s Choice Award, in the PDD Hoarding Design Competition 2019 (Secondary School Category

We hope that our achievements and experiences will continue to spur our members to face challenges with Creativity and Confidence.
