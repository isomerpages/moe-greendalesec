Robotics Club was started in 2016 as an extension to our school’s Applied Learning Programme in Design, Technology and Engineering. The club believes in providing ample opportunities for our members to “Dream, Design and Build”.

Students undergo training during CCA sessions which equip them with basic workshop skills, understanding of electronics and coding which enables them to develop their analytical thinking and problem solving skills. In addition, students are developed and nurtured in the makers mindset through the training and use of CAD software such as Solidworks, Autodesk Inventor and Autodesk Fusion 360.

Utilizing the skillsets acquired, students design and realize their own creations through 3D printing and laser cutting. Students are also able to build and program their own robots to fulfill a given task/problem and further enrich their experience through participation in competitions.

To widen the students’ knowledge in STEM and its applications, students embark on learning journeys to places like Mint Toy Museum, Science Centre, Make the Future Singapore exhibition, Google Office and Aviation Open House.

Above all, we firmly believe in nurturing our students’ resilience, self-discipline, character and 21st CC skills through the 4 years of CCA experience.
