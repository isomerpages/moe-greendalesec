<p>At GDLS Robotics, we are more than just a "coding club”. We are an incubator
for the next generation of engineers, designers, and innovators. We empower
students to transform abstract ideas into tangible solutions for real-world
challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Core Pillars</strong></h4>
<p>Our 4-year program is developed to move students from foundational skills
to innovation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>i. Design &amp; Fabrication: </strong>Applying
industrial-grade CAD software (e.g., SolidWorks and Autodesk Fusion 360)
to design custom parts, brought to life through 3D Printing and Laser Cutting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ii. Coding &amp; Intelligence:</strong> Moving
beyond basic logic to explore Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Micro-electronics
(using Arduino and Anniken Andee for app-controlled robotics).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>iii. Agile Problem Solving:</strong> Utilizing
the Design Thinking framework to prototype solutions for Singapore-relevant
issues like sustainability and smart urban living.</p>
<h4>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Character &amp; Future-Readiness</strong></h4>
<p>We nurture the 21st Century Competencies essential for the future workforce:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> i. Resilience: </strong>Debugging
complex code and troubleshooting mechanical failures teaches a "never give
up" attitude.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>ii. Collaboration: </strong>Most
projects require team synergy, role specialization, and effective communication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>iii. Ethics in Tech:</strong> We cultivate
an understanding of the responsible use of AI and technology in modern
society.</p>
<h4>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>The CCA Experience</strong></h4>
<p>We don't just sit in a lab; we are immersed in the local and global tech
ecosystem:</p>
<p><strong>i. Developing a Maker Mindset:</strong>
</p>
<p>In addition to the opportunities during the CCA, members are encouraged
to build their personal portfolio of projects. This archive (intended as
Reflective Learning) is a stepping-stone to future pursuits. Very much
like a Designer’s sketchbook.</p>
<p><strong>ii. Industry Exposure:</strong>
</p>
<p>Learning journeys to Singapore's tech hubs (e.g., A*STAR, Google, or local
GovTech offices) to see robotics in action.</p>
<p><strong>iii. Competitions and Challenges:</strong>
</p>
<p>We have participated recently in; IDE Series-IDE Maker Competition, National
Youth Tech Championship (NYTC), Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT)
Community Challenge, VEX Robotics (DSTA-DSO-VJC Robotics Challenge), National
Olympiad of Artificial Intelligence (NOAI)</p>

<p><em>In Robotics, we don't just build machines; we build the confidence to solve problems that don't have an answer key yet</em>
