<p>Greendale Broadcasting Club (GBC) - a CCA which provides students with
an exciting platform to explore storytelling through different forms of
media. Members learn to work hands-on with sound, photography, and videography,
gaining practical skills while expressing their creativity.</p>
<p>Our members learn to operate and manage the various sound systems, supporting
morning assemblies and school events. From the onset, members are introduced
to handling DSLR cameras, allowing them to build confidence in photography
and videography to build up their portfolio.</p>
<p>Members also have opportunities to develop core journalism skills, including
planning, filming, interviewing, and editing in a 26-hour program using
iPads. Every year, they will participate in “Our Schools, Our Stories”
competition, organized by MOE. GBC achieved the distinction award for the
Infocomm Media Club Youth Awards in 2022.</p>
<p>Beyond technical competencies, the club nurtures teamwork, communication,
and responsibility. By participating in the club, members build confidence,
technical competence, and a deeper appreciation of media as a powerful
tool for communication within the school community.</p>
