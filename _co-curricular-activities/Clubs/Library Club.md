In Greendale, student librarians aim to promote a love for reading and self-discovery through books.

Student librarians put up monthly IP book displays and NE Exhibitions and Quizzes. Members also organize inter-class competitions for all level annually. These include Story-Telling Competitions, Scrabble Competitions, Character-drawing Competitions, Comic Strip writing Competition and Skills Demonstration Competition.

Student librarians also learn the basics of how libraries operate by picking up skills such as the loaning of books system, display presentation skills, organization skills, research skills, and oratorical skills.

Students with leadership potential will also get the opportunity to guide juniors in the running of competitions.
