<h4><strong>Our Vision: Every Member a Leader</strong></h4>
<p>At the Art and Culture Club (ACC), we believe every member is a leader
who is <strong>Creative, Confident, and Compassionate.</strong> Our mission
is to nurture resilient individuals who possess a strong sense of team
spirit and a heart for others.</p>
<h4><strong>Cultivating Artistry and Collaboration</strong></h4>
<p>As a budding new CCA, members get to develop their creative abilities
while working together to add vibrancy and highlight the themes for our
various school celebrations. Through weekly sessions, members get to brainstorm
and share ideas, see their creations take shape and take pride in the appreciation
of their efforts.</p>
<p>We curate workshops that are conducted by qualified professionals which
help to develop cultural/social awareness while exploring the creative
significance of the visible art forms. Among the workshops conducted in
2025 are:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Batik Painting/Weaving Workshop</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peace Paintings: Mindful watercolor brushstrokes</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peranakan Culture-inspired Latch Hooking</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Other significant priorities</strong></h4>
<p>THRIVE Day @ GDLS. This is an interschool competition that challenged
students in their language and literary skills. The content of each task
is developed and finetuned by ACC to be intellectually stimulating and
challenging for the yearly competition.</p>
<p>KidsREAD (NLB program). Storytelling and guidance activities conducted
by our students to make reading and imagination come alive for primary
school students. Selected ACC members get to develop their oratory skills
and realise the influence of their endeavors that are conducted during
our weekly CCA.</p>
