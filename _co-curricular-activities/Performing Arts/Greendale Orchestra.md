<p>Greendale Orchestra is a vibrant ensemble comprising plucked strings,
bowed strings, woodwinds and percussion instruments. It provides students
with a nurturing platform to develop their musicianship, discipline and
teamwork while discovering the joy of making music together.</p>
<p>With more than 70 members, the Orchestra emphasises both individual growth
and collective excellence through weekly sectional and combined practices
led by experienced music instructors. Sectional practices focus on building
strong technical foundations in small instrument-based groups, while combined
practices bring all sections together to perform as a unified orchestra.</p>
<p>The Orchestra meets every Monday and Wednesday from 2.45 p.m. to 5.45
p.m., where students also take part in bonding sessions that strengthen
friendships and team spirit.</p>
<p>Greendale Orchestra performs regularly at the school’s biannual concert
ELADNEERG and its annual community engagement performances at Oasis Terraces,
Rhythms of Greendale. In 2025, the Orchestra achieved a Certificate of
Accomplishment at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation.</p>
