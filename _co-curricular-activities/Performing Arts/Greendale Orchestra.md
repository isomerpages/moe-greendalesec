Greendale Orchestra is made up of plucked strings, woodwinds, bowed strings and percussion instruments. The Orchestra provides a platform for young musicians to share their passion and create music together. With more than 70 members, Greendale Orchestra aims to nurture young musicians through our weekly sectional and combined practices conducted by experienced music instructors. During sectional practices, students are grouped according to their instruments and are taught by instructors in small groups. Combined practices allow students to play together as an orchestra.

In 2020,  the Ministry of Education’s Arts Education Branch published a promotional video for the Visual Performing Arts CCA. The video served as a platform to raise awareness of the benefits of students participating in VPA CCA. Greendale Orchestra is grateful for the opportunity to be one of the seven schools featured in this video.
