<h4><strong>Who are we?</strong></h4>
<p>The Angklung &amp; Kulintang Ensemble is a musical group that plays the
traditional Indonesian instruments, Angklung and Kulintang, which originated
from West Java and Sulawesi respectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>What is an Angklung?</strong></h4>
<p>An Angklung is a musical instrument which comprises two to four bamboo
tubes loosely supported in a square bamboo frame. They slide to and fro
freely when the instrument is shaken sideways, producing a broken ‘klung’
noise, thus the name, Angklung. Each Angklung produces a single note and
in an ensemble, each member plays an important role in shaking their own
Angklung.</p>

<h4><strong>Kulintang</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>Indonesian Kulintang set is often used as accompaniment instrument to an Angklung Ensemble in Singapore.</strong>
</p>
<p>The name "Kulintang" comes from Minahasa (North Sulawesi). The words mean: <em>kuling</em> (low
tone), <em>tang</em> (high tone), and <em>tang</em> (the sound produced by
knocking the planks). Traditionally, Kulintang was played in social gatherings.</p>
<p>The instrument is made from lightweight but resonant woods of the <em>Wenang</em> tree
(<em>Octomeles sumatrana</em>), which produce clear and rich tones. It
consists of wooden bars arranged in a row, similar to a xylophone, and
is played using mallets with rubber-tipped heads.</p>

<h4><strong>Achievements</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<h4>Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) at SOTA</h4>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2019, 2023 &amp; 2025: Certificate of Distinction</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>2021: Certificate of Accomplishment</strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SYF 2025:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Angklung Ensemble represented the school at the 2025 SYF Arts Presentation
at SOTA, performing to two songs: <em>Reverie</em> and <em>Waves of Hope</em>. <em>Reverie</em>,
composed during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlights perseverance through
adversity, while <em>Waves of Hope</em>, written in 2004, commemorates tsunami
victims. Both pieces were composed and arranged by our dedicated instructor,
Mr Dzul.</p>
<p>Preparing since October 2024, the journey was filled with challenges,
with early practices barely meeting passing standards. Despite SYF falling
on the first day of Term 2, the support of teachers, Mr Dzul, and EXCO
leaders helped build persevere in students and helped the CCA achieve a
Certificate of Distinction.</p>
