<p>Greendale Chorale is an all-girls’ choir established in 2006. The choir
provides a nurturing platform for budding singers to share their passion
for music while honing their vocal and musical skills. Through regular
training and performances, choristers develop not only strong musicianship
but also confidence, discipline, and leadership qualities.</p>
<p>Led by our instructor, Mr Raymond Lee, Greendale Chorale has had numerous
opportunities to perform and compete on a wide range of platforms. The
choir performs regularly at the school’s biannual concert, <em>ELADNEERG</em>,
as well as at its annual community engagement performances at Oasis Terraces
- Rhythms of Greendale. These performances showcase a diverse repertoire,
ranging from musical theatre pieces from Phantom of the Opera to well-known
Singaporean song.</p>
<p>Greendale Chorale’s dedication and growth have been recognised with the
prestigious Certificate of Distinction at the Singapore Youth Festival
Arts Presentation in 2019 and 2023, a testament to the choir’s commitment
to excellence.</p>
<p>In 2025, Greendale Chorale was selected to participate in the SG60 National
Day Parade, a significant national event. Our choristers were honoured
to be part of this celebration and shone on stage as they sang and danced
to popular National Day songs such as <em>“We Are Singapore”</em> and <em>“The Road Ahead”</em>.
This memorable experience further strengthened their sense of teamwork,
resilience, and national pride.</p>
