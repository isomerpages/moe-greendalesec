<p>Theatricks! provides students with a rich and purposeful platform to learn
the fundamentals of theatre-making and performance while developing a deep
appreciation for the art form. Through a structured training programme,
aspiring thespians are equipped with essential theatrical skills, including
lighting, sound, and stage direction, and are guided to use their bodies
effectively to create characters, stage actions, and visual images.</p>

<p>Learning in the club is highly collaborative, with students co-creating
various elements of performances alongside instructors and teachers, fostering
teamwork and creative ownership. Structured reflections are embedded throughout
the programme to help students become mindful of their growth and learning
journey. Beyond hands-on training, students broaden their perspectives
through career talks and learning journeys to experience professional drama
performances.</p>
