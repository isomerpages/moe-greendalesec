_The best acting is instinctive. It's not intellectual, it's not mechanical, it's instinctive.”_  
\- Craig MacDonald

For the students, being in Theatricks! provides them with an outlet to express their emotions- acting makes them feel more alive. We leave the stage with no regrets. We don’t dictate, we don’t force, we provide guidance and ideas, but it is up to the students to create the end product. 

Every week, the students go through hours of actor’s training, stage blocking and countless runs of scenes and the whole performance. It takes a team working together both on stage and back stage to eventually create that final piece on stage. 

We nurture students to become confident individuals and draw on their youthful exuberance and fearlessness to tackle any role head on. The values that develop in our students become life skills. Our efforts have been recognized as the drama group attained the Certificate of Accomplishment (2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019) in the Singapore Youth Festival.
