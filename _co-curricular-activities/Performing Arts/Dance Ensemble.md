The Movement and Dance Club  was formed in 2010 under the guidance of the instructors, Mr Benedict Soh and Ms Liz Fong. The aim of the Movement and Dance Club is to provide the opportunity for students with passion for dance to acquire the skills and techniques, and to perform at various platforms, so that they could fulfil their desire and also pursue it as a hobby after they leave school. **Dance**, the movement of the body in a rhythmic way, usually to music and within a given space, for the purpose of expressing an idea or emotion, releasing energy, or simply taking delight in the movement itself.

The comprehensive and rigorous training programme which is built on the school values of self-discipline and diligence provides intensive yet enjoyable lessons that hone the students’ skills and stretch their potential to the fullest. Students start with the basic skills in ballet at secondary one and progress to higher skills as they move on to the upper levels. The instructors prepare the   students for SYF and various other school events. These platforms provide students a great way to perfect their performance skills. While these experiences make students become better dancers and most importantly individuals of character, it is hoped that they will transfer the learning to their own lives and also contribute to the community in some ways in future.  We are proud of our Singapore Youth Festival achievements which includes Silver (2011), Certificate of Accomplishment (2013, 2015 and 2017) and Certificate of Distinction (2019).

In 2017, Dance Ensemble is proud to have participated in Chingay Parade.
