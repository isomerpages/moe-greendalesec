<p>Floorball provides students with a dynamic and engaging platform to develop
both sporting skills and strong character. Through regular training and
competition like NSG and friendly matches, students learn the importance
of teamwork, discipline, and commitment, as success in floorball depends
on cooperation, communication, and mutual support. Floorballers also learn
to persevere through setbacks and are encouraged to continuously reflect
on their performance to improve it. Beyond physical fitness and agility,
the Floorball CCA nurtures confidence, leadership, and responsibility,
empowering students to grow into well-rounded individuals who embody the
school’s values while representing the school with pride.</p>
