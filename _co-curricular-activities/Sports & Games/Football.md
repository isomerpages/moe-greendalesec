<p>Founded in 2010 as an interest group by Mr Harold Ho and Mr Ng Jin Rong,
the CCA was officially recognised in 2011, with Mr Kelvin Chan joining
the teaching team in 2012.</p>
<p>Anchored in a strong emphasis on character and values development, the
three dedicated teacher-coaches guided and trained the team without external
coaching support until 2022. During this period, the team achieved notable
successes, most prominently in 2018, when Greendale placed 4th in the zone
and qualified for the National Competition (B Division).</p>
<p>In 2023, external coaches were engaged in response to the introduction
of a new league system, which significantly increased inter-school fixtures
and extended the competition season from January to August.</p>
<p>In recent years, Greendale has continued to perform strongly, securing
3rd place in 2023 and emerging as Champions in 2025 (C Division – League
4).</p>
<p>As a CCA, Greendale remains committed to nurturing discipline, teamwork,
respect, and resilience in its student-athletes, while striving for excellence
both on and off the field.</p>
