Greendale footballers are involved in a year-long programme that seeks to stretch and develop not only their playing and tactical abilities but also their values. During CCA sessions, the players get to hone their technical skills with various drills and also develop their teamplay in small-sided or modified games. Values and sportsmanship are emphasized by the teachers and coaches, who hope Greendale footballers can develop character and leadership both on and off the field.

Due to the extraordinary circumstances brought about by Covid-19, the team was (at the time of writing) unable to experience many of the usual highlights such as the National Interschool Football Competition, conducting VIA activities at Waterway Primary and the annual CCA bonding camp. However, the team is motivated to prepare and do well for the following year. With outdoor training suspended, the coaches and CCA Leaders worked together to prepare home-based CCA sessions to help continue engaging the players. These included both online tactical learning and individual drills to improve fitness and technique.
