<p>The Canoeing CCA is an exciting and challenging sports CCA that offers
students a unique opportunity to learn, grow, and thrive through the sport
of canoeing. Whether you are completely new to the sport or looking to
push yourself further, the Canoeing CCA welcomes students who are ready
to challenge themselves both physically and mentally. Through regular training
sessions on land and water, students learn what it means to persevere,
work as a team, and take pride in their progress. More than just a sport,
canoeing is a journey of self-discovery, resilience, and camaraderie.</p>
<p>As a member of the Canoeing CCA, students will develop strong technical
and physical skills that are essential to the sport. These include mastering
paddling techniques, improving balance and boat control, understanding
race strategies, and building strength and endurance through structured
land training. Safety is a key focus, and students also learn important
water safety skills that help them become confident and responsible paddlers.</p>
<p>Students are exposed to a range of enriching programmes, such as the <strong>1-Star Kayaking Certification</strong>,
where they gain foundational kayaking knowledge and skills, as well as <strong>the annual Sea Expedition </strong>that
allow them to apply what they have learnt in real-life environments beyond
the calm waters. Members of the CCA also represent the school in the <strong>National Inter-Schools Canoeing Championships (National School Games)</strong>,
experiencing the thrill, discipline, and pride of competing at a national
level.</p>
<p>The Canoeing CCA strongly supports the development of key 21st Century
Competencies outlined by MOE. Through demanding training sessions and competitions,
students build <strong>resilience and self-management</strong>, learning
how to cope with fatigue, setbacks, and pressure. As canoeing is both an
individual and team sport, students also strengthen their <strong>communication and collaboration skills,</strong> working
closely with teammates to improve performance. Students are given opportunities
to take on leadership roles and responsibilities, helping them develop <strong>leadership skills, integrity, and accountability</strong>.
They learn to reflect on their performances, adapt their techniques, and
respond to changing water and weather conditions, nurturing <strong>critical and adaptive thinking</strong>.
These soft skills are valuable not only in the CCA, but also in school
and future life beyond the classroom</p>
