The Greendale Softballers undergo rigorous physical and skills set training that meet the high standards set by Coach Marcus and his team of coaches. The numerous trainings develop resilience, discipline and teamwork in them. In 2020, the B Division Girls Team made it to the Top 8 Teams in the National Inter-School Softball Championship but the National School Games were subsequently curtailed due to COVID-19 Circuit Breaker Measures. Consequently, our Softballers also had to be innovative during training sessions and make the necessary modifications to take into account the need for safe-distancing and social responsibility. Despite the changes, our Softballers continue to adapt to the New Normal in such extraordinary times and strive to do their best!
