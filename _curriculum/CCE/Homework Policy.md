The aim of homework is to encourage and support studentsâ€™ learning. It is to allow students to demonstrate mastery of the concepts taught in class so that teachers can utilise the information to plan for future lessons. Homework allows students to take ownership of their learning and inculcate good study habits.

### The amount of homework

1. Quality of homework is as important as quantity.

2. The guidelines for the amount of homework to be given is as follows:

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg .tg-1wig{font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
.tg .tg-dox4{background-color:#FFF;color:#3A3A3A;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
.tg .tg-c1uv{background-color:#FFF;color:#3A3A3A;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
</style>
<table class="tg">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-c1uv"></th>
    <th class="tg-c1uv">Daily</th>
    <th class="tg-c1uv">March/ Sept holidays</th>
    <th class="tg-1wig">June/ December holidays</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-c1uv"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:inherit">Amount</span></td>
    <td class="tg-dox4"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit">2 hours/ day (Lower Sec)</span><br><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit">2.5 hours/ day (Upper Sec)</span></td>
    <td class="tg-dox4"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit">1 hour/ subject</span></td>
    <td class="tg-dox4"><span style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit">Up to 3 hours/ subject</span></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

3. During Class Test periods, the amount of homework should be moderated (e.g. subject teacher may give homework but students are not required to submit the assignment during CT week OR subject teachers to give a longer period of time for students to finish the assignment). The rationale for this is to help students manage the competing demands of homework, revision for CT, remedials and CCA.

4. During CCA competitions or SYF periods, subject teachers will take the heavier demands of CCA into consideration for affected students.
