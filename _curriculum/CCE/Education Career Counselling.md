**Education and Career Guidance (ECG)**&nbsp;at GDLS aims to equip our students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values, to make decisions for successful transition from school to further education or work.

The programmes under&nbsp;**GDLS ECG Framework**&nbsp;will enable our students to:

*   Explore viable education and career options through the provision of accurate and comprehensive information.
*   Nurture self-awareness, self-directedness and lifeskills to set wise goals, so that they will continually learn and add value to their future workplace.
*   Inculcate an appreciation for the value of all occupations and how they contribute to the well-functioning of the society.

### Careers Day

The objective of the Careers Day is to inspire the Sec 3 students to explore career paths and post-secondary education options. Students attend talks by guest speakers from a wide variety of industries in the morning and visit post-secondary education institutes or industries in the afternoon.

### Experience Poly / ITE Programme

Students spent a few days immersing themselves in one of the Poly / ITE courses to get a taste of life as a Poly/ITE student and experience the facilities offered.

### Work Attachment Programme

The Work Attachment Programme is a 5-day work-readiness

programme designed to increase students’ understanding of the skills needed in the workplace. Students learn how to research options, and acquire new skills that are necessary to pursue a career, such as preparing a portfolio. The work attachment experience also enhances the students’ future education or career prospects.
