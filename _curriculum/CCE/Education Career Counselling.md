<h3>Careers Day</h3>
<p>The objective of the Careers Day is to inspire the Sec 3 students to explore
career paths and post-secondary education options. Students attend talks
by guest speakers from a wide variety of industries in the morning and
visit post-secondary education institutes or industries in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>Experience Poly / ITE Programme</h3>
<p>Students spent a few days immersing themselves in one of the Poly / ITE
courses to get a taste of life as a Poly/ITE student and experience the
facilities offered.</p>

<h3>Work Attachment Programme</h3>
<p>The Work Attachment Programme is a 5-day work-readiness</p>
<p>programme designed to increase students’ understanding of the skills needed
in the workplace. Students learn how to research options, and acquire new
skills that are necessary to pursue a career, such as preparing a portfolio.
The work attachment experience also enhances the students’ future education
or career prospects.</p>
