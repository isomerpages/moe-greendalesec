### VISION

To develop students into servant leaders who are rooted, demonstrate our school values and 21st Century Competencies and able to make positive changes.

### An Overview

Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) at Greendale focuses on developing our students through a specially designed curriculum of classroom lessons, programmes and experiences, and leadership opportunities during their journey in Greendale. At Greendale, we believe every school experience is a CCE experience, and every teacher a CCE teacher. Our curriculum is customised to help our students achieve each of the following level outcomes.

### Classroom Experiences

The highlight of CCE at Greendale is in its customised CCE curriculum, termed as “iLiVE’’ which is short for Lifeskills and Values Education for the i-generation.  Li (Lifeskills) address ECG, Sexuality Education and Cyberwellness, while VE (Values Education) is the formal platform to teach school values and to foster civic literacy in the area of Citizenship Education. Greendale’s iLiVE Curriculum takes reference from MOE’s CCE Curriculum and is designed to be progressive in nature to achieve MOE’s CCE themes and Greendale’s cohort-based level outcomes. At the same time, in order to meet the learning needs of the students at Greendale, iLiVE lessons are customised to be experiential and outdoor-learning based.

### Classroom Experiences

Besides classroom lessons to acquire the relevant skills and knowledge in CCE, Greendale students are also exposed to a wide suite of programmes to enhance their learning experiences. Students are actively involved during our Citizenship Education (CE) commemoration events, engaged in learning through our Education & Career Guidance (ECG) programmes to be future-ready, and actively serving those around them through our progressively designed Values-in-Action (VIA) opportunities.

**Commemorating key National events**

We commemorate key national events in Greendale as part of our Citizenship Education. Students are actively engaged in learning during these programmes through a series of classroom lessons and assembly programmes. As with our focus on experiential learning, our students are active participants in these programmes. For examples, during our annual National Day Celebrations, our Secondary 3 students plan and execute a Social Enterprise Bazaar to raise awareness and funds for our partner beneficiary. As part of our nation’s goal towards an inclusive society, our students chose mental health as the theme and focus for the bazaar.

**Serving others through Values-in-Action programmes**

At Greendale, we believe that every student can be a servant leader who are able to make positive changes. Our Values-in-Action programmes are designed to be progressive, to encourage our students to make active steps to better the lives of those around them. As we often say, small actions can have big impact. Through these programmes, our students learn to initiate their own projects to positively impact those around them.
