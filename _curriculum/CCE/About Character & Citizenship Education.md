### VISION

To develop students into servant leaders who are rooted, demonstrate our school values and 21st Century Competencies and able to make positive changes.

### An Overview

Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) at Greendale focuses on developing our students through a specially designed curriculum of classroom lessons, programmes and experiences, and leadership opportunities during their journey in Greendale. At Greendale, we believe every school experience is a CCE experience, and every teacher a CCE teacher. Our curriculum is customised to help our students achieve each of the following level outcomes.

### Classroom Experiences

The highlight of CCE at Greendale is in its customised CCE curriculum, termed as “iLiVE’’ which is short for Lifeskills and Values Education for the i-generation.  Li (Lifeskills) address ECG, Sexuality Education and Cyberwellness, while VE (Values Education) is the formal platform to teach school values and to foster civic literacy in the area of Citizenship Education. Greendale’s iLiVE Curriculum takes reference from MOE’s CCE Curriculum and is designed to be progressive in nature to achieve MOE’s CCE themes and Greendale’s cohort-based level outcomes. At the same time, in order to meet the learning needs of the students at Greendale, iLiVE lessons are customised to be experiential and outdoor-learning based.

### Classroom Experiences

Besides classroom lessons to acquire the relevant skills and knowledge in CCE, Greendale students are also exposed to a wide suite of programmes to enhance their learning experiences. Students are actively involved during our Citizenship Education (CE) commemoration events, engaged in learning through our Education & Career Guidance (ECG) programmes to be future-ready, and actively serving those around them through our progressively designed Values-in-Action (VIA) opportunities.

**Commemorating key National events**

We commemorate key national events in Greendale as part of our Citizenship Education. Students are actively engaged in learning during these programmes through a series of classroom lessons and assembly programmes. As with our focus on experiential learning, our students are active participants in these programmes. For examples, during our annual National Day Celebrations, our Secondary 3 students plan and execute a Social Enterprise Bazaar to raise awareness and funds for our partner beneficiary. As part of our nation’s goal towards an inclusive society, our students chose mental health as the theme and focus for the bazaar.

**Serving others through Values-in-Action programmes**

At Greendale, we believe that every student can be a servant leader who are able to make positive changes. Our Values-in-Action programmes are designed to be progressive, to encourage our students to make active steps to better the lives of those around them. As we often say, small actions can have big impact. Through these programmes, our students learn to initiate their own projects to positively impact those around them.

**Learning to be future-ready through Education and Career Guidance Programmes**

Education and Career Guidance Programmes aims to equip our students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values, to make decisions for successful transition from school to further education or work.  Our students have the opportunity to explore post-secondary educational pathways through talks and learning journeys to post-secondary institutions, as well as explore career pathways through our annual Careers Day and Work Experience Programmes.

### Talent Development & Student Leadership

At Greendale, we believe that every student can be a leader. We aim to build confident leaders with the heart to serve. A wide variety of training and opportunities are afforded to develop leaders at each level. Students have the opportunity to serve as subject representatives in their classes, take on leadership positions in their CCAs and in the school as CCA leaders and Student Councillors respectively. 

Greendale’s student leadership development programme is guided by the principles of Servant Leadership by Robert Greenleaf.

_The servant-leader is servant first. It begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve. Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead. The best test is: do those served grow as persons: do they, while being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants? And, what is the effect on the least privileged in society; will they benefit, or, at least, not be further deprived?  
(Greenleaf, 1977/2002)_

The Greendale Student Leadership Journey is based on Servant Leadership principles. The inverted pyramid signals how leaders with greater responsibilities need to support the rest of the student population through the ability to serve.  

There are outcome goals for each of the 5 levels of leadership tied to the Servant Leadership traits. Minimally, all students should seek to become responsible leaders. At the highest level of leadership, we aim for our student leaders to demonstrate the traits of being a servant leader.

### Training

We believe in providing a variety of training for our students. All Greendale students are exposed to Servant Leadership as part of the Class Committee training at the beginning of each year. Dedicated trainings are also provided to expose students to the traits of Servant Leadership. Our appointed Student Leaders can look forward to our school’s signature Aspiring Leaders’ and Inspiring Leaders’ Training Programmes from Secondary 2 onwards.

### Opportunities

Our student leaders are given the opportunity to serve in various capacities after receiving training. Student Councillors are involved in organising and carrying out the different school events such as Teacher’s Day celebrations. Sports leaders are involved in planning and running the annual Inter-Class Games. Our CCE ambassadors organise and spearhead CCE engagement initiatives such as Anti-Bullying and Cyberwellness Week.
