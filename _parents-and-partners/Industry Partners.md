Through our partnership with **Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT)**, our students are given the opportunity in the following programmes:

**SIT Challenge**

Started in 2019, the SIT Challenge is a competition co-organised by Greendale Secondary and SIT for the Sec 2 cohort. Students work on the challenge as part of their Sec 2 Design & Technology lessons.

Each year, the school will be partnered with community organization(s) to co-create solutions to solve community challenges.

The challenge aims to :

*   increase students’ awareness of issues that affect the community and encourage them to take actions to tackle the issues by developing possible solutions.
*   allow students to learn and apply the design thinking process and put it into action

Students who are shortlisted for the finals will have the opportunity to present their ideas to a panel of judges consisting of our community partners and SIT representatives.
