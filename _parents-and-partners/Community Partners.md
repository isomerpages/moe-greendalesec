In Greendale Secondary School, we believe in giving back and **serving our community**. Our school values the collaborations with our community partners to benefit those in our community. At the same time, these collaborations provide learning opportunities for our students to develop empathy to become **servant leaders** who can go on to make positive changes in the society.

**Partnering Community Homes as part of our Secondary 2 VIA programme**

As part of Greendale’s Secondary 2 VIA programme, our students plan and visit our partner homes to learn more about the issues and challenges faced by the elderly. During the visit, students interact with the residents to find out more about their issues, and return to school to design a prototype to solve these challenges.

In 2020 and 2021, due to the Covid-19 situation, students were unable to physically visit the residents in our community partner homes. However, the students came up with videos of performances and notes, which were delivered to our partner homes to continue to engage and encourage the residents.

As part of our Secondary 3 VIA programme, our school partners Touch Community to raise awareness and funds to advocate and support mental well-being. Each year, Touch Community conducts a workshop/talk for our Secondary 3 students, to help them better understand the issues related to mental health. With a deeper understanding of the challenges, our students work on advocacy materials and videos to help their schoolmates better understand the issues, along with advice to promote the importance of mental well-being. To support the efforts by Touch Community in championing mental well-being in the community, the proceeds of the school’s signature Social Enterprise Bazaar organised annually by the Secondary 3 students goes towards Touch Community.

Being part of the Punggol Community, Greendale believes in partnering our neighbouring community to address social issues. As part of the Secondary 4 VIA programme, the school works closely with HDB to collaborate on projects that aim to promote social cohesiveness and build the “Kampung” spirit.

In 2019, our Secondary 4 students embarked upon a ‘Thank you neighbour’ campaign in Punggol to promote good neighbourliness in the community. Students organised various activities around the Punggol estate and Oasis Terraces, to encourage neighbours to partake in programmes together, or write notes and create gifts of appreciation for their neighbours.

In 2020, the students were unable to engage the Punggol residents due to the Covid-19 situation. However, they created videos to encourage the residents to stay positive and adhere to safe management measures to promote both public mental and physical health among the Punggol community.
