With the belief that Every Parent is a Supportive Partner, the PSG was started in 2011. The school strives to tap into the diverse talent and expertise of the parents to enhance the school programmes and to enrich the learning experiences of the students.

Parents are invited to participate in various school events such as Honours Day and the Jogathon. Beyond the efforts to engage the parents as a collective group, efforts are also directed towards the PSG which provides support in the advocacy of the school’s direction and programmes. The PSG serves as a representative of the parents’ voices, provide constructive feedback and support towards the school’s progress, and support school functions and events through their presence and participation.

PSG complements the school by aligning with the school’s objectives and vision while providing mutual support and assistance, wherever possible, towards the school’s programmes.

As a partner in the education journey of our children, we work closely with the school and organise programmes and events that help to build a stronger bond and relationship between the school, student and parent.

Studies show that students are more academically successful when there is a strong parent-school connection.

Parents are encouraged to join our support group which ensures regular communication with their child's teachers.

PSG often serves as a platform for school-related queries to be raised; giving the school an opportunity to present their views on matters of concern to parents and hearing the parents’ perspectives.

The PSG and the school seek to achieve a synergetic relationship for the common good of our children in GDLSS.
