The metaphor illustrates a young plant deeply rooted to ground, nurtured and challenged to thrive and rise above life challenges. It encapsulates the heart of what we hope for each and every one of our Greendale student where they continuously strive to Grow and Glow @ Greendale.

**Grow and Glow @ Greendale** is about **knowing** oneself,  **appreciating** the unique strengths of each individual  and **challenging** oneself to become the best version of being a **Learner, Thinker and Leader**. Beyond that, it also focuses on how one can **make a difference for others** through their actions and deeds, bringing good cheer to the people around, and fulfilment to themselves.
