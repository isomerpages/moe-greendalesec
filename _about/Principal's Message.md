It is a privilege to be given the opportunity to lead Greendale Secondary School (GDLS) from 15 December 2021. The school has come a long way since its beginning in 2006 and we celebrated our 15th anniversary in 2021. Under the leadership of three different Principals over a period of 15 years, the school has grown to be one which is able to provide an all-rounded and holistic education aimed at growing students to be life-long learners, critical thinkers and confident leaders. To achieve this, the school has continuously anchored its programmes and processes to nurture talents, develop character and inspire lives. Credit to the strong leadership, inspiring and supportive staff, and ever-committed community partners and parents for this successful journey we are embarking on.

It’s my hope to continue this journey of excellence and care where every staff and student matters. Every student has his or her innate talent, interest and potential. We strive to bring the best out of them to value-add holistically in the cognitive, leadership, aesthetics, moral and social, and physical domains. In doing so, we aim to get students of the Greendale family to take each experience in life as a learning experience.

I am indeed privileged to be taking over the leadership of a school with such a positive track record. I joined the teaching service in 1996 and since then have had the opportunity to play various roles including Subject Head, Head of Department, Curriculum Planning Officer at MOE HQ and Vice Principal. Having served as Principal of Naval Base Secondary School for eight years, this is my second stint as Principal.

On the family front, I am blessed with a loving family with my wife and four children being my pillars of strength. Being a father of four children has allowed me to understand how each child is different and has his or her own innate potential and strengths. Thus, differentiating my parenting to suit each child’s need and taking the time to connect and engage with each of them has been very important to ensure I work towards being a responsible father to my children. In doing so, I believe that it is important to anchor my family and children in values and behaviors which will bring them far in life as persons with good character.

Likewise, as a school, we pride ourselves as a family where everyone matters. We look forward to working in close partnership with parents and community partners to serve and nurture students in the Greendale family to become someone they and the community would be proud of.

Looking forward to a rich learning experience for all at Greendale Secondary School.
