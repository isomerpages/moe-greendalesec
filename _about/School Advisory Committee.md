<p>This photograph captures the faces of most of the School
<br>Advisory Committee who came together for their final meeting of 2024.
Joined by school leaders, teachers, and staff, the committee reflected
on a year marked by collaborative growth and meaningful achievements. Their
insights and guidance throughout the session underscored a shared commitment
to fostering a nurturing, dynamic environment where every student can thrive.
<br>As a gesture of appreciation, each committee member received a plant from
the school’s garden—symbolizing Greendale’s dedication to sustainability
and growth. Here’s to many more shared milestones ahead!</p>
