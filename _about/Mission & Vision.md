### School Mission:


<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 26px;"><em><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Nurturing Talents, Developing Character, Inspiring Lives</strong></span></em></span></p></blockquote>

Our mission hinges on the school’s strong belief and aspiration to develop every member of the Greendale community to be a life-long **Learner** who takes personal responsibility and initiative in his own development and personal mastery, a critical **Thinker** who seeks clarity and possibilities, and a confident **Leader** who seeks to serve his community with humility and confidence.

### SCHOOL VISION:

<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 26px;"><em><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Learner. Thinker. Leader.</strong></span></em></span></p></blockquote>

### STRATEGIC DESTINATION:

<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 26px;"><em><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Our Home, Our Pride - where every Learner, Thinker and Leader Matters and Makes a Difference.</strong></span></em></span></p></blockquote>

Leveraging our strengths and addressing growing challenges as well as opportunities, the school will strengthen our culture to exude deep care and trust as we more deliberately engage and involve our stakeholders, beyond staff and students, leaving no one behind, and making a difference for others.

### SCHOOL METAPHOR:  

The metaphor illustrates a young plant deeply rooted to ground, nurtured and challenged to thrive and rise above life challenges. It encapsulates the heart of what we hope for each and every one of our Greendale student where they continuously strive to Grow and Glow @ Greendale.

**Grow and Glow @ Greendale** is about **knowing** oneself,  **appreciating** the unique strengths of each individual  and **challenging** oneself to become the best version of being a **Learner, Thinker and Leader**. Beyond that, it also focuses on how one can **make a difference for others** through their actions and deeds, bringing good cheer to the people around, and fulfilment to themselves.
