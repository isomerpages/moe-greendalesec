<h4><strong><u>2026 School Leaders’ Website Message:</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>A Message to All Greendale Students</strong>
<br><strong>Growing and Glowing into 2026!</strong>
<br>2025 has been an incredible year for Greendale — filled with energy, teamwork,
and unforgettable moments. From GARANG and Jogathon to our Games Carnival
and Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT)<strong> </strong>Challenge,
every event showed the Greendale spirit in action. You’ve learned, grown,
and shone in so many ways, and we couldn’t be prouder of how far we’ve
come together as one Greendale family.
<br>
<br>As we look ahead, 2026 promises to be another exciting year of <em>growth, exploration, and purpose</em>.
We will continue to live out our vision of developing lifelong learners,
critical thinkers, and servant leaders, guided by our R<sup>3</sup>ISE
values of <em>Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Self-discipline, and Empathy</em>.</p>
<p>At the heart of Greendale is a culture of care — a place where we look
out for ourselves and one another, learn from our mistakes, and grow stronger
through every challenge. Here, we value both performance character (like
perseverance, responsibility, and excellence) and moral character (like
empathy, fairness, and integrity). We celebrate effort as much as achievement,
and we believe that true success comes not from fear, but from respect
— respect for ourselves, for others, and for the community we share.
<br>You can look forward to:</p>

<p>Together with our teachers, parents, alumni, and partners — including
the School Advisory Committee members, Parent Support Group, RSAF, and
Cloversoft — we will continue to make Greendale a place where everyone
feels safe, supported, and inspired to grow.
<br>Let’s step boldly into 2026 — ready to Grow and Glow brighter than ever!</p>
