The full suite of programmes on offer, such as our signature GARANG, Jogathon and the SIT challenge have provided numerous opportunities for our students to grow their heart and minds and we have taken huge pride in all their glow moments. We acknowledge the hard work that so many have put in to make this possible – our Greendale family, our partners, our School Advisory Committee and of course parents who have journeyed with us along the way.</p><p>Our vision of each Greendale student as a lifelong learner, critical thinker and servant leader continues to keep us focused in our work. This is a vision that continues to be relevant and necessary as we prepare our students for the future of work, for a diverse and inclusive society and for a productive and fulfilling life. We take pride in knowing that each student that passes through our hands is imbued with our RISE values, ready to lead, to serve and to excel in the world beyond.</p><p>We continue to strengthen our collaborative, thinking and safe culture in all that we do. Our teachers work together to create learning opportunities that enable our students to acquire vital communication skills, while at the same time developing strong digital and civic literacy. The Out-of-school Learning Experience which we continually refine is one area where our students can collaborate not just with each other but with partners and stakeholders through authentic learning tasks. In programmes such as those in our niche areas of outdoor adventure and design, technology and engineering, we seek to challenge our students to think adaptively and inventively to approach real-world problems. And we continue to promote a safe culture where student voices are heard and included – our townhalls provide an avenue for students’ ideas to be weaved into our school curriculum, campus design and even our school rules.</p><p>The inspiring Grow and Glow story series by our Principal continues to be regular start to each school week, while we have added Spotlight on the morning assembly menu as we end the week thinking and discussing current affairs. We are looking forward to greater student involvement in these platforms in 2024 as we hold the belief in empowering and encouraging our students and having their voices be heard. We will also be launching the Greendale Global Classroom, where selected Sec 3 students will have an opportunity to go for an overseas learning journey to expand their perspectives and cultural sensitivities.</p><p>In 2024, we will see a greater focus on sustainability education. We have included our students’ ideas in developing a part of the school into a place for greater awareness, action and advocacy of the environment. Complementing this will be our new CCA, the Green Club, where students will be taught how to set up, maintain and care for the new flora under their charge.</p><p>We look forward to an exciting 2024 as we continue to work closely with all our partners, including our latest new partner, Cloversoft. We express our heartfelt thanks to all who are part of the Greendale Experience, as we seek to grow and glow as a Greendale family.</p><p>To a happy and enriching 2024!</p>
