<p>Our Greendale Experience has indeed been rich and vibrant this year. The
full suite of programmes on offer, such as our signature GARANG, Jogathon,
Games Carnival and the SIT challenge have provided numerous opportunities
for our students to grow their heart and minds and we have taken huge pride
in all their glow moments. We acknowledge the hard work that so many have
put in to make this possible – our Greendale family, our partners, our
School Advisory Committee and of course parents who have journeyed with
us along the way.</p>
<p>Our vision of each Greendale student as a lifelong learner, critical thinker
and servant leader continues to keep us focused in our work. This is a
vision that continues to be relevant and necessary as we prepare our students
for the future of work, for a diverse and inclusive society and for a productive
and fulfilling life. We take pride in knowing that each student that passes
through our hands is imbued with our RISE values, ready to lead, to serve
and to excel in the world beyond.</p>
<p>We continue to strengthen our collaborative, thinking and safe culture
in all that we do. Our teachers work together to create learning opportunities
that enable our students to acquire vital communication skills, while at
the same time developing strong digital and civic literacy. The Out-of-school
Learning Experience which we continually refine is one area where our students
can collaborate not just with each other but with partners and stakeholders
through authentic learning tasks. In programmes such as those in our niche
areas of outdoor adventure and design, technology and engineering, we seek
to challenge our students to think adaptively and inventively to approach
real-world problems. And we continue to promote a safe culture where student
voices are heard and included – our connect and engage programmes provide
an avenue for students’ voices to be weaved into our school curriculum,
campus design and even our school rules.</p>
<p>The inspiring Grow and Glow story series by our Principal continues to
be regular start to each school week, while we have added Spotlight on
the morning assembly menu as we end the week thinking and discussing current
affairs. We are looking forward to greater student involvement in these
platforms in 2025 as we hold the belief in empowering and encouraging our
students and having their voices be heard. We will also be launching the
Greendale Global Classroom, where selected Sec 3 students will have an
opportunity to go for an overseas learning journey to expand their perspectives
and cultural sensitivities.</p>
<p>In 2025, we will see a greater focus on sustainability education. We have
included our students’ ideas in developing a part of the school into a
place for greater awareness, action and advocacy of the environment. Complementing
this will be our new CCA, the Green Club, where students will be taught
how to set up, maintain and care for the new flora under their charge.</p>
<p>We look forward to an exciting 2025 as we continue to work closely with
all our partners, Parent Support Group, the Alumni, RSAF and Cloversoft.
We express our heartfelt thanks to all who are part of the Greendale Experience,
as we seek to grow and glow as a Greendale family.</p>
<p>To a happy and enriching 2025!</p>
