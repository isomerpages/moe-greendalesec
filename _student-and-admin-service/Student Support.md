<p>Greendale Secondary School offers a suite of student support services
for students requiring additional support in various areas.</p>
<h3>Counselling</h3>
<p>Counselling involves providing a safe environment for students to share
their challenges and work through their social, emotional, behavioural
and mental health issues with a trained counsellor.</p>
<p>Our school counsellors support students by helping them learn and use
strategies to manage and cope with their emotions or situation, while working
closely with the teachers and family. This enables them to make choices
for positive change and development, and they gain self-efficacy over time.</p>
<h3>Special Education Needs Officer</h3>
<p>Our Special Education Needs Officer provides support to students with
mild special educational needs such as dyslexia, ADHD or mild ASD and sensory/physical
impairments studying in mainstream schools.</p>
<h3>Education &amp; Career Guidance Counsellor</h3>
<p>Our ECG counsellor helps students at schools, polytechnics and ITE explore
their strengths, interest and aspirations. Through conversations with the
students, she support students in achieving their post-secondary aspirations.</p>
<h3>Student Health Advisor</h3>
<p>The SHA is a qualified and trained nurse stationed in selected secondary
schools. Our SHA provides advice and guidance for the students with health-related
issues so that timely intervention and follow up, if necessary, can be
offered to them.</p>
