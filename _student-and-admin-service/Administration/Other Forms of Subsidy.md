### Home Access Programme

The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) has introduced Home Access Programme which provides 2 years of subsidised Internet broadband to low-income households.

Eligible students may consider taking up the programme if they do not have Internet connection at home.

Please refer to [http://www.digitalaccess.gov.sg/](http://www.digitalaccess.gov.sg/) for more information.

### NEU PC Plus Programme

**Secondary school students will no longer be eligible to apply with effect from 1 Jan 2022**

As shared by then-Minister of Education, Lawrence Wong on 29 Dec 2020, all Secondary school students will own a Personal Learning Device (PLD) under MOE’s National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) by end of 2021.

In view that all secondary school students will own a PLD under MOE’s Digital Literacy Programme, **secondary school students will no longer be eligible to apply for the NEU PC Plus (NPP) programme with effect from 1 Jan 2022**. For appeals by Secondary 5 students to apply for NPP, we will take it on a case by case basis.

**Extend waiver of community service for iNSPIRE Fund till 31 Mar 2022**

Since 8 Apr 2021, IMDA has worked with our partners to provide additional support under the NPP programme for families with school-going children during the Covid-19 situation. In view that the primary school students are not vaccinated yet, we take a more cautious approach and will _waive the community service requirement for iNSPIRE Fund till 31 Mar 2022_.
