**_MOE Secondary 1 Posting Exercise Process_**

### 1. How many Secondary 1 classes are there in 2021?

There are **8** Secondary 1 2021 classes in total:

As it is one of the 28 secondary schools selected by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to pilot aspects of Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB). Under Full SBB, students will take the following subjects together at a common level at lower secondary: Art, Character & Citizenship Education, Design & Technology, Food & Consumer Education, Music and Physical Education. For all other subjects, students will be grouped in classes according to the level at which they offer each subject.

This common learning experience creates a valuable setting for students to mingle, build meaningful friendships, and appreciate different perspectives.

**Our indicative PSLE score ranges are indicated below:**

Meeting the indicative PSLE Score range does not mean your child will be admitted to the school. The indicative PSLE Score range shows the PSLE Score of the first and last student admitted into The indicative PSLE score range will not always be the same as the actual PSLE score range for the current year.

The actual COPs are not pre-determined before the posting and may vary from year to year depending on students’ PSLE results and their school choices **_for that particular year’s S1 Posting Exercise_**.
