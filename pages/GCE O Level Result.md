<p>Dear Parents/Guardians</p>
<p></p>
<p>The 2025 GCE O-Level Examination results will be released on <strong>Wednesday, 14 January 2026</strong> at
2pm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As your child reaches this significant milestone, it is important to remind
them that their worth is not defined by their grades but by the character
and resilience they have developed throughout their journey. Your support
will be invaluable in helping them manage their emotions and stay positive
as they consider their next steps.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Collection of GCE O-Level Results</strong>
</p>
<p>Students who are collecting results are to report to school and be <strong>seated in the School Hall by 1:45pm</strong>.
They are expected to be in school attire with proper grooming. Parents/Guardians
may accompany their child/ward to their school to collect their results.</p>
<p>Students who are unwell should seek medical attention and not return to
school to collect their results. Students who are unable to collect their
results in person can also appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy of
their results from the school. Proxies are required to produce the relevant
documents for the school’s verification when collecting the results. Students
may contact the school for assistance with the appointment of a proxy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please note that parking is not available within the school premises.&nbsp;
Visitors are encouraged to use the carparks in the neighbouring HDB blocks.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Joint Admission Exercise (JAE)</strong>

<p>Students who wish to apply for admission to junior colleges (JC), Millennia
Institute (MI), polytechnics, and the Institute of Technical Education
(ITE) may do so via the Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE) using their GCE
O-Level examination results.</p>
