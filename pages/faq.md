# General

**_MOE Secondary 1 Posting Exercise Process_**

### 1. How many Secondary 1 classes are there?

There are **8** Secondary 1 classes in total. There are approximately 40 students per class.

Greendale Secondary School is one of the 28 secondary schools selected by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to pilot aspects of Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB). Under Full SBB, our form classes are a mix of Express and Normal stream students and they will take the following subjects together at a common level at lower secondary: Art, Character & Citizenship Education, Design & Technology, Food & Consumer Education, Music and Physical Education. For all other subjects, students will be grouped in classes according to the level at which they offer each subject.

This common learning experience creates a valuable setting for students to mingle, build meaningful friendships, and appreciate different perspectives.

**Our indicative PSLE score ranges are indicated below:**

Meeting the indicative PSLE Score range does not mean your child will be admitted to the school. The indicative PSLE Score range shows the PSLE Score of the first and last student admitted into The indicative PSLE score range will not always be the same as the actual PSLE score range for the current year.

The actual COPs are not pre-determined before the posting and may vary from year to year depending on students’ PSLE results and their school choices **_for that particular year’s S1 Posting Exercise_**.

With the new PSLE scoring system, more students will have the same PSLE Score, and schools will be less differentiated based on cut-off points. Choice order will be introduced as a tie-breaker to recognize the different considerations that families have in making school choices.

**S1 Posting Tie-Breakers (in order of priority)**

1\. Citizenship (priority given to Singapore Citizens, followed by Permanent Residents and International Students)  
2\. Choice order of schools  
3\. Computerised balloting

### 6. Are there any remedial lessons after school?

For Lower Secondary and Secondary 3, only selected students who require additional learning support in certain subjects will have to attend remedial lessons on Tuesdays and/or Thursdays.

For Secondary 4/5, our school provides a structured Extended Academic Programme (from Term 1 – Term 4) as well as Night Study Programme (Term 3 – Term 4) to support the students.

### 7. Does your school have any Talent Development Programmes?

We have adopted the following three strategies for our Greendale Talent Development Programme:

*   **Exposure** - for students to have an experience in the various Greendale Signature Programmes such as Design, Technology and Engineering, Outdoor Adventure Education, and the Greendale Scientist Programme.
*   **Extension** - for students who show deeper interest and strength in their respective fields, in the form of special enrichment activities and programmes.
*   **Excellence** - for outstanding students who desire to excel in their respective fields, through a targeted approach such as inter-school and national competitions.

### 8. Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) from 2020

Greendale Secondary School is one of the 28 secondary schools selected by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to pilot aspects of Full SBB from 2020 onwards. As part of the pilot, our school will be implementing the following:

(a) Providing Secondary 2 Students with the Opportunity to offer Humanities subjects* at a more demanding level

**This is applicable to students who are in Secondary 2 Normal (Academic) from 2020.**

To help ensure that students can fully benefit from the opportunity and enjoy their learning, the school has adopted the following eligibility criteria:

*   75% overall for the subject
*   60% overall for all subjects; and/or
*   Teachers’ professional recommendations

Students who offer Humanities at a more demanding level will sit for the same examinations as students in Express.

_Benefits from offering Humanities at a more demanding level_

With this increased flexibility in customising our students’ learning experience, we better recognise their strengths and nurture their intrinsic motivation to learn.

(b) Reorganised Form Classes at Secondary 1

**This is applicable to new Secondary 1 students entering our school in 2020.**

Students will take the following subjects together at a common level at lower secondary: Art, Character& Citizenship Education, Design & Technology, Food & Consumer Education, Music and Physical Education. For all other subjects, students will be grouped in classes according to the level at which they offer each subject. 

_Benefits from new ways of organising form classes_

This common learning experience creates a valuable setting for students to mingle, build meaningful friendships, and appreciate different perspectives.

_Note: Amongst the 3 Secondary Schools in Punggol, 2 are pilot schools (Edgefield Secondary and Greendale Secondary)._

Find out more about Full SBB [here](https://www.moe.gov.sg/microsites/psle-fsbb/full-subject-based-banding/main.html).

### 9. Why is Greendale Secondary School chosen as a Full SBB pilot school?

Experience in implementing in SBB.

Consistent positive student outcomes.

Readiness of our school to cater to different learning needs.

# Co-Curriculum

### 1. Are there any swimming lessons in Secondary 1?

The school conducts a compulsory swimming programme for all Secondary 1 students during PE lessons. The objectives of the programme are to help students gain water confidence and competence and/or achieve a higher certificate in the SwimSafer Award.  
  
If your son/daughter is unable to attend any of the swimming lessons due to a particular reason, our PE Department will consider the matter on a case-by-case basis.

### 2. Are there also any leadership development/ opportunities for students?

As a student in Greendale, your child will have a variety of leadership training and opportunities. For example, all students in Greendale hold a leadership position in class. They will be trained in servant leadership principles during the coming Orientation Camp and Class Exco training sessions. These will equip them with the necessary skills to serve the class and others. At higher levels, they will have the opportunity to take on greater leadership roles such as CCA Leaders, Sports Leaders and Student Councillors, who plan and lead school-wide events. There will also be opportunities for students to undergo our Aspiring Leaders and Inspiring Leaders Training programmes and camps in Secondary 2 and 3 respectively.  
 

### 3. What kind of overseas learning journeys can Greendale Secondary students look forward to?

The highlight of our Secondary 3 Inspiring Leaders Training Programme is an overseas training camp, typically held in Gopeng, Perak. Students will have opportunities to put their leadership and cross-cultural skills into practice during the camp.

The school also organised its inaugural educational trip to Beijing in November 2019 for selected Secondary 2 students, to further instill the Maker’s mindset in our students as well as increase their awareness of educational reforms and changes in a different cultural context.

# Miscellaneous

**Finance Matters**

### 1. School Fees Matters

[https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/fees](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/fees)

### 2. How do I make payments?

For cheque payments, please make them payable to "Greendale Secondary School", and send them personally to the school's General Office.

For cash payments, they can be made directly at the school's General Office.

### 3. Financial Assistance Scheme and Bursaries

**DSA:**

### 4. Where can I find out more about the Direct School Admission (DSA) to Greendale Secondary School?

[/student-admin-services/administration/admission/direct-school-admission/](https://greendalesec.moe.edu.sg/student-admin-services/administration/admission/direct-school-admission/)

### Academic Matters (MTL):

### 5. My child was exempted from the MTL exam at PSLE. Does he/ she still need to study a MTL at Secondary School?

If your child was exempted from taking the MTL exam at PSLE because he/she has applied to study a foreign language, your child will still need to register for a foreign language as a MTL-in-lieu at Secondary School. Please see Mr Goh C H, HOD MTL, for processing. Without a MTL or MTL-in-lieu, your child will not be able to register for the National Exams at the end of Secondary School education.

If your child was granted exemption because he/she fulfilled a condition stated in Question 2 (see below), it would be clearly stated on the official letter of exemption (which your child received in Primary School) that your child will no longer need to reapply for exemption at Secondary School. In such a case, your child will not be required to sit for the MTL exam at ‘N’ or ‘O’ level.

### 6. I would like to apply for permanent MTL exemption for my child. How can I go about doing it?

Under the bilingual policy, all students must study two languages: English Language and a Mother Tongue Language.

Students will only be considered for exemption if they meet any of the following criteria:

1) Student only joined the Singapore education system mid-stream (e.g. an international student who joined a Singapore school only at Primary 5), or

2) Student has certain special needs or medical conditions (e.g. autism, severe dyslexia) If a student wants to apply for exemption and meets at least one of the above criteria, he or she could fill up

Please see Mr Goh C H, HOD MTL, with all supporting documents, for submission to MOE.

### 7. My child is studying a NTIL (Non-Tamil Indian Language) in Primary School. Does he/ she need to reapply at Secondary School? Are there NTIL lessons conducted in school?

Students who have obtained approval at the primary level to study a NTIL are not required to reapply at Secondary School. They must continue to offer the approved non-MTL or NTIL at secondary and pre-tertiary levels. There are no NTIL lessons in school. Students studying NTIL are required to attend lessons with the NTIL community groups and sit for examinations set by the Board for the Teaching and Testing of South Asian Languages.

### 8. My child opted to study a third language. Why was the application unsuccessful?

Students who opted to study a third language do not automatically qualify for entry into the programme. Selection is entirely based on merit and determined solely by each applicant’s PSLE results.

**Others:**

### 9. Attire and grooming during non-curriculum periods.
